This work aimed to determine compounds in green coffee beans and find the differentiation of green coffee beans into special or traditional ones through chemometrics. For that, the levels of phenolic compounds, reducing, nonreducing, and total sugars were quantified by spectrophotometry: caffeine, trigonelline, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), 3-hydroxybenzoic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, chlorogenic, caffeic, and nicotinic acids (NAs) by high-performance liquid chromatography–UV–Vis; acetaldehyde, acetone, methanol, ethanol, and isoamyl by HS-GC-FID. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to differentiate green coffee beans through the levels obtained in spectrophotometric and chromatographic analyses. Statistically, the contents of total phenolic compounds, caffeine, nonreducing sugars, total sugars, NA, 5-HMF, acetaldehyde, ethanol, and ethanol/methanol showed significant differences. The PCA made it possible to classify green coffee beans into special and traditional, in addition to understanding the attributes that influenced the differentiation between coffees. In addition, it was possible to classify green coffee beans into special and traditional, either using all parameters evaluated or only using spectrophotometric analyses. In this way, some advantages allow classification without using a trained and experienced evaluator as their previous experience can influence the results due to their expertise in a certain type of coffee, in addition to being faster and cheaper, especially regarding spectrophotometric analyses. © 2023 Institute of Food Technologists.

Hence, a proper understanding of mechanisms that control DOM binding properties in the soil is important for major environmental challenges, such as climate change and stream pollution. However, the role of DOM source in those mechanisms remains understudied. Here, we consider poorly drained tropical Podzols as a model environment to isolate effects of aluminium and DOM on sorption and desorption processes in podzolisation. We collected E- and Bh-horizons from a Brazilian coastal Podzol under tropical rainforest to conduct a column experiment, and percolated the columns with DOM collected from a stream (Stream), peat water (Peat), litter (Litter) and charred litter (Char). To quantify sorption and desorption from the columns, leachates were analysed for DOC content, aluminium content, pH, and the amount of fulvic acid relative to humic acid. The results showed large differences in DOC retention between DOM-types, which were consistent over all columns. Retention of DOC in the column varied between 25 % and 92 % for DOM-type Stream, between 33 % and 63 % for DOM-type Peat, between 22 % and 47 % for DOM-type Litter, and between 8 % and 49 % for DOM-type Char. Similarly, desorption from columns with B-horizon material highly differed between DOM-types. Percolation with DOM-types Stream and Peat caused a release of native DOC from B columns that was higher than in those percolated with water only. On the other hand, percolation of B columns with DOM-types Litter and Char caused a net DOC retention. These differences reflect that certain DOM-types hindered desorption, while other DOM-types caused active desorption. The large differences in sorption/desorption between DOM-types implies that changes in environmental conditions may highly influence the fate of soil carbon in Podzols. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, this study aimed to examine the effects of different soybean-maize management practices on the diversity and composition of soil microbial communities. Specifically, 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to investigate whether the use of pasture species in a fallowing system influences microbial communities in a soybean-maize rotation system, as compared to conventional tillage and no-tillage systems. The results indicate that the inclusion of the pasture species Urochloa brizantha in soybean-maize management systems leads to distinct responses within the soil microbial community. It was found that different soybean-maize management systems, particularly those with U. brizantha, affected the microbial community, likely due to the management applied to this pasture species. The system with 3 years of fallowing before soybean-maize showed the lowest microbial richness (∼2000 operational taxonomic units) and diversity index (∼6.0). Proteobacteria (∼30%), Acidobacteria (∼15%), and Verrucomicrobia (∼10%) were found to be the most abundant phyla in the soil under tropical native vegetation, while soils under cropland had an increased abundance of Firmicutes (∼30% to ∼50%) and Actinobacteria (∼30% to ∼35%). To summarize, this study identified the impacts of various soybean-maize management practices on the soil microbial community and emphasized the advantages of adding U. brizantha as a fallow species. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH	Article	Scopus

In Brazil, the crop typically occurs in a conventional tillage system (CT), which favors the mineralization and decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) and the loss of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). On the other hand, the no-tillage vegetable system (NTVS) operates based on sustainable pillars and bypasses the adverse effects of CT. This study evaluated the total C and N stocks and particle-size fractions of SOM in NTVS with single and intercropped cover plants compared to vegetable crops under CT. The NTVS evaluated treatments were as follows: (1) spontaneous vegetation (SV); (2) black oats (BO); (3) rye (RY); (4) oilseed radish (OR); (5) RY + OR; and (6) BO + OR. A treatment under CT with millet cover, a no-tillage system with (NTS) millet + velvet + sunflower cover, and a forested area as the original condition was also evaluated. Soil samples were collected in 0–5, 5–10, and 10–30 cm layers. Stocks of total organic C (TOC), total N (TN), particulate OC (POC), particulate N (PN), mineral-associated OC (MAOC), and mineral-associated N (MN) were evaluated. The highest stocks of TOC, TN, POC, and NM were found in NTVS compared to CT, and RY + OR showed the best results. The NTVS showed higher TOC and TN stocks with grasses and cruciferous intercropped than NTVS with SV and CT. POC and PN stocks increased in areas with single and intercropped RY and OR treatments. MAOC and MN stocks were higher than forest in RY + OR intercrop in the topsoil layer. RY and OR intercrop efficiently added C and N to the soil under NTVS. The consortium of millet + velvet + sunflower in NTS showed higher TOC, TN, POC, and PN stocks compared to the other treatments (0–5 and 0–30 cm). In general, the intercrop of cover plants is ideal for obtaining the NTVS maximum potential, favoring several mechanisms between soil, plant, and atmosphere, resulting in improved soil quality, increased organic matter, and higher stocks of C and N. © 2023 by the authors.

However, these organisms are also found in marine, terrestrial and extreme environments and produce unique compounds, other than toxins. Nevertheless, their effects on biological systems are still barely known. This work tested extracts of different cyanobacterial strains against zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae and analyzed their metabolomic profiles using liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Strains Desertifilum tharense, Anagnostidinema amphibium, and Nostoc sp. promoted morphological abnormalities such as pericardial edema, edema in the digestive system region, curvature of the tail and spine in zebrafish larvae in vivo. In contrast, Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorogloeopsis sp. did not promote such changes. Metabolomics revealed unique compounds belonging to the classes of terpenoids, peptides, and linear lipopeptides/microginins in the nontoxic strains. The toxic strains were shown to contain unique compounds belonging to the classes of cyclic peptides, amino acids and other peptides, anabaenopeptins, lipopeptides, terpenoids, and alkaloids and derivatives. Other unknown compounds were also detected, highlighting the rich structural diversity of secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacteria. The effects of cyanobacterial metabolites on living organisms, mainly those related to potential human and ecotoxicological risks, are still poorly known. This work highlights the diverse, complex, and unique metabolomic profiles of cyanobacteria and the biotechnological potential and associated risks of exposure to their metabolites. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Plant breeding for resistance against soil-borne pathogens can alter the rhizosphere microbiome. However, most studies have focused on bacterial and fungal communities, leaving the role of the virus and viroids unassessed. Here, we tested the influence of resistance breeding on the composition of rhizosphere viruses and viroids. By analyzing metatranscriptomes from the rhizosphere of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) cultivars with varying resistance to the soil-borne pathogen Fusarium oxysporum, we recovered sequences representing 78 and 23 novel populations of viruses and viroids, respectively. We compared the abundances of these infectious agents across the different cultivars and found that the Fusarium-resistant cultivar harbored >1.2 times more viroids and a more different composition of viroids and viruses than less resistant plants. Given their role in interfering with host metabolism and their potential influence on plant-fungi associations, our study suggests that changes in the rhizosphere infectome are an important consideration in breeding for resistance against soil-borne pathogens. © 2023 The Authors	Article	Scopus

Especially in the field of biodiversity genomics, the development of low-cost DNA sequencing opens an opportunity for new actors beyond academia to engage in genomic sequencing. However, it is challenging to adequately compensate non-academic actors such as local populations for their contribution to the innovation process, preventing better bioeconomy development. Although many repositories register genomic data to support biodiversity research, they do not facilitate the fair sharing of economic benefits. In this work, we propose the creation of the Amazon Biobank, a community-based genetic database. We employed blockchain to build a transparent and verifiable log of transactions involving genomic data, and we used smart contracts to implement an internal monetary system for all participants who collect, insert, process, store, and validate genomic data. We also used peer-to-peer solutions to allow users with commodity computers to collaborate with the storage and distribution of DNA files. By combining emerging technologies, Amazon Biobank provides adequate benefit-sharing among all participants that collaborate with data, knowledge, and computational resources. It also provides traceability and auditability, allowing easy association between biotechnological research and DNA data. In addition, the solution is highly scalable and less dependent on the trust deposited in any system player. Therefore, Amazon Biobank can become an important stepping stone to unlock the potential of bioeconomy in rich ecosystems such as the Amazon Rainforest. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Gaertn.] population from Primavera do Leste, MT, Brazil, with resistance to multiple herbicide modes of action (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase [EPSPS] inhibition: glyphosate; acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase [ACCase] inhibition: aryloxyphenoxypropionate chemical group). The objective was to identify possible mechanisms of resistance associated or not with herbicide sites of action. Several experiments and analyses were carried out with the contribution of different laboratories and institutions. The results obtained allowed us to conclude that: (1) the Asp-2078-Gly mutation conferred resistance to ACCase inhibitors, without overexpression of ACCase or changes in herbicide absorption and translocation; (2) overexpression of EPSPS, Thr-102 and Pro-106 mutations, and changes in absorption and translocation are not involved in E. indica resistance to glyphosate; (3) the metabolism of glyphosate in resistant E. indica plants requires further studies to elucidate the final destination of this herbicide in these plants. The mechanism of resistance of E. indica biotypes to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides was elucidated: it involves a change in the action site. However, the mechanism of resistance to EPSPS inhibitors was not conclusive, indicating that some hypotheses, mainly those regarding the metabolism of glyphosate in resistant plants, require further testing.  © The Author(s), 2023.

However, it is unclear how the microbial communities in the rhizosphere of different sugarcane genotypes respond to Si application. This study assessed the effect of Si application on the prokaryotic communities in the rhizosphere of three sugarcane genotypes (RB021754, RB036066, RB92579) during the stages of plant cane and ratoon, through the 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The composition of prokaryotic communities varied by comparing genotypes and Si application in both plant cane and ratoon. In the sugarcane plant, the relative abundance of Planctomycetes and Gemmatimonadetes decreased in the rhizosphere of genotype RB021754, while the relative abundance of Proteobacteria increased in the rhizosphere of genotype RB92579 with Si application. Regarding ratoon cane, the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Thaumarchaeota, and Planctomycetes increased in the rhizosphere of genotypes RB021754, RB036066, and RB92579, respectively, after Si application. At the genus level, Catenulispora, Sphingoaurantiacus, Luteitalea, and Flavisolbacter presented a positive correlation with Si application, while Alloprevotella, Gaiella, Sporomomusa, and Tahibacter presented a negative correlation. Also, there was an enrichment of N-fixers and plant growth-promoter microbes after Si application. This study has shown that Si application affected prokaryotic diversity and changed the abundance of specific microbial groups, which varied according to different genotypes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The abundance and activities of beneficial root microbial taxa at the time prior to and during fungal infection are key to their protective success. If and how invading fungal root pathogens can disrupt microbiome assembly and gene expression is still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the impact of the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum (fox) on the assembly of rhizosphere and endosphere microbiomes of a fox-susceptible and fox-resistant common bean cultivar. Results: Integration of 16S-amplicon, shotgun metagenome as well as metatranscriptome sequencing with community ecology analysis showed that fox infections significantly changed the composition and gene expression of the root microbiome in a cultivar-dependent manner. More specifically, fox infection led to increased microbial diversity, network complexity, and a higher proportion of the genera Flavobacterium, Bacillus, and Dyadobacter in the rhizosphere of the fox-resistant cultivar compared to the fox-susceptible cultivar. In the endosphere, root infection also led to changes in community assembly, with a higher abundance of the genera Sinorhizobium and Ensifer in the fox-resistant cultivar. Metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses further revealed the enrichment of terpene biosynthesis genes with a potential role in pathogen suppression in the fox-resistant cultivar upon fungal pathogen invasion. Conclusion: Collectively, these results revealed a cultivar-dependent enrichment of specific bacterial genera and the activation of putative disease-suppressive functions in the rhizosphere and endosphere microbiome of common bean under siege. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

We applied a new strategy to measure the water retention in soils with coarse fragments (CFs) and to get insights into the effect of CFs porosity on water retention. Water retention at zero, 10, and 150 m suction, bulk density, and the mass fraction of six particle size classes were measured in undisturbed blocks from soils with variable CFs contents, originating from three parent materials. The results showed that some soils contain porous CFs (2–250 mm) with a water holding capacity as high as the fine fraction (<2 mm). The water held in the suction range of 1–150 m in a soil with porous CFs was twice as high as in soils with non-porous CFs. Multilinear regressions revealed that both the water retention capacity at 1 m suction and in the range 1–150 m were more dependent on bulk density than on the fraction of CFs and fine particles. In the soil with porous CFs, there was no correlation between their fraction and soil water retention. These results show that the bulk water retention capacity of soils with CFs is underestimated when not considering the internal porosity of the CFs. A better understanding of the effect of the porosity of CFs on bulk soil porosity and water retention is important to propose suitable pedotransfer functions and refine physically-based hydraulic functions for stony soils. © 2023 British Society of Soil Science.

The current study characterizes the retention of diclosulam and diuron in forage turnip (FT), buckwheat (BW), and black oat (BO) straws. Radiometric techniques evaluated the sorption–desorption and leaching processes. Spectroscopic and microscopic methods characterized chemical and morphological alterations in the straw. Sorption rates (Kf) of diclosulam and diuron followed the order BO > BW > FT. Irreversible sorption (hysteresis < 0.7) occurs to diclosulam applied to BO straw. The BO straw showed porous structures, indicating physical entrapment of the herbicides. Straw fragments (<1 mm) increased the sorption of herbicides. The increase in straw amount (2.5 to 5 t ha−1) reduced herbicide leaching to 18.8%. Interactions between chemical groups (C-Cl, C-F, and C-N) from herbicides with straw characterize a chemical barrier. The present research suggests that entrapment and chemical interaction are involved in the sorption–desorption process of herbicides, such as diclosulam and diuron, in the straw matrix, directly interfering with their availability in the environment. This process can reduce the herbicide environmental risk but can decrease weed control efficiency. © 2023 by the authors.	Article	Scopus

Multiple lines of evidence prove that in cyanobacteria all MAAs are derived from mycosporine-glycine, which is typically modified by an ATP-dependent ligase encoded by the gene mysD. The function of the mysD ligase has been experimentally described but haphazardly named based solely upon sequence similarity to the d-alanine-d-alanine ligase of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Combining phylogeny and alpha-fold tertiary protein structure prediction unambiguously distinguished mysD from d-alanine-d-alanine ligase. The renaming of mysD to mycosporine-glycine-amine ligase (MG-amine ligase) using recognised enzymology rules of nomenclature is, therefore, proposed, and considers relaxed specificity for several different amino acid substrates. The evolutionary and ecological context of MG-amine ligase catalysis merits wider appreciation especially when considering exploiting cyanobacteria for biotechnology, for example, producing mixtures of MAAs with enhanced optical or antioxidant properties. © 2023 The Authors.

The present study aimed at evaluating the trade-off between dwell time and XRF performance for assessing soil fertility attributes. A total of 102 soil samples acquired in two Brazilian agricultural fields were used, whose spectra were obtained using dwell times of 90, 60, 30, 15, 10, 7, 4, and 2 s to build and validate calibration models for clay, cation exchange capacity, and extractable K and Ca. Results revealed that it is possible to make drastic reductions in the XRF dwell time (from 90 to 2 s), while keeping excellent prediction performance [ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) between 3.52 and 8.32] for all the studied attributes. A dwell time of only 2 s performed satisfactorily and is an analysis time suitable for rapid in situ applications. In addition, it was shown that data from spectral databases previously collected that used long dwell times (e.g., 30, 60, 90 s) can be extrapolated to fast applications with shorter dwell times (e.g., 2 and 4 s), once standardization by the detector's live time has been performed. Anyhow, calibrations using a dwell time similar to the one of the validation set tended to show superior results and are therefore recommended. This study addresses the need and provides guidelines for optimizing XRF sensor analysis time for in situ applications in the context of precision agriculture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Among them, the maneb has been used to produce several fruits and vegetables, but its high ingestion can adversely affect human health. This work developed the Solid-Liquid Phase Microextraction (SLPME) for extraction of the maneb in foods sample with posterior determination by Flow injection analysis-Flame Absorption Atomic Spectroscopy (FIA-FAAS). Curve analytical had a linear range from 0.9 to 20.0 µmol L−1 maneb (A = 5.94 × 10−4 C (µmol L−1) + 6.93 × 10−4), good repeatability (4.07%) and reproducibility (3.39%), limits of quantification (5.98 µmol L−1) and detection (0.197 µmol L−1), which was above of the established by regulatory agencies. The extraction of the maneb was performed using 685 µL of the solution of the 1.00 × 10−3 mol L−1 of EDTA, and it has excellent recovery values from 80.85 to 106.51%. Therefore, the developed SLPME demonstrated an alternative environmentally friendly for quickly extracting maneb from food samples (apple, papaya, and tomato). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

However, this same condition impairs cell growth, which may limit the microalgae’s large applications. Several studies have identified significant physiological and molecular changes that occur during the transition from an abundant to a low or absent nitrogen supply, explaining in detail the differences in the proteome, metabolome and transcriptome of the cells that may be responsible for and responsive to this condition. However, there are still some intriguing questions that reside in the core of the regulation of these cellular responses that make this process even more interesting and complex. In this scenario, we reviewed the main metabolic pathways that are involved in the response, mining and exploring, through a reanalysis of omics data from previously published datasets, the commonalities among the responses and unraveling unexplained or non-explored mechanisms of the possible regulatory aspects of the response. Proteomics, metabolomics and transcriptomics data were reanalysed using a common strategy, and an in silico gene promoter motif analysis was performed. Together, these results identified and suggested a strong association between the metabolism of amino acids, especially arginine, glutamate and ornithine pathways to the production of TAGs, via the de novo synthesis of lipids. Furthermore, our analysis and data mining indicate that signalling cascades orchestrated with the indirect participation of phosphorylation, nitrosylation and peroxidation events may be essential to the process. The amino acid pathways and the amount of arginine and ornithine available in the cells, at least transiently during nitrogen deprivation, may be in the core of the post-transcriptional, metabolic regulation of this complex phenomenon. Their further exploration is important to the discovery of novel advances in the understanding of microalgae lipids’ production. © 2023 by the authors.	Article	Scopus

When herbicides are applied in mixtures, interactions may affect their environmental fate. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the distribution of extractable residue, bound residue, biodegradation, and mineralization of diuron, hexazinone, and sulfometuron-methyl when applied alone and in a mixture in two agricultural soils. Biometric flasks filled with two types of soil (clay and sandy) collected from an area cultivated with sugarcane and treated with 14C-radiolabeled solutions of the herbicides were incubated for 70 d. More 14C–CO2 was released when sulfometuron-methyl and hexazinone were applied in a mixture compared to when applied alone. Being used in a combination did not affect the mineralization of diuron. The soil texture directly influenced the mineralization, bound residue, and extractable residue of the three herbicides. The percentage of extractable residue decreased over time for all herbicides. Hexazinone and sulfometuron-methyl had the highest residue extracted on sandy soil when applied alone. Diuron showed the highest percentage of bound residue. The degradation of the three herbicides was higher in the clay soil regardless of the mode of application, which is related to the higher potential of the bacterial community in the clay soil to mineralize the herbicides. © 2023 The Author(s)	Article	Scopus

However, the dynamics of nutrient uptake by tree roots in the early stages of stand development, depending on the lateral distance from the trees and the depth in the soil, are poorly documented. We assessed the potential uptake of N, K and Ca, from 6 to 18 months after planting, by Eucalyptus grandis trees depending on: i) the lateral distance from the tracer injection point and ii) the depth in the soil. At 6 months after planting, we injected 15NO3–, Rb+, Sr2+ and Cs+ tracers at depths of 1, 3, 5, and 7 m, respectively. Recently expanded leaves were then sampled monthly on 16 target E. grandis trees located at lateral distances ranging from 0.75 to 11.1 m from the injection points, and on 4 more distant E. grandis control trees; 15N contents (atom %) and concentrations of Rb, Cs and Sr in the leaves were determined at each sampling date, and compared to those of control trees to detect the dates of tracer uptake for each individual. A LOESS model was applied to account for the temporal trend and inter-tree variability among the control trees. Tracer uptake by a target tree was detected if the measurements exceeded the upper limit of the prediction interval (α = 0.005) generated by the model. Only the 6 target trees located within 2.0 m from the injection point took up the 15NO3– tracer. However, Rb+, Sr2+ and Cs+ tracers were taken up to lateral distances of approx. 11 m from the injection point. Tracer uptake occurred as early as 9, 7, 8 and 9 months after planting for 15NO3–, Rb+, Sr2+ and Cs+, respectively. Four trees located within 2.8 m from the injection point took up the 3 cation tracers, injected between the depths of 3 m and 7 m. All but one of the target trees took up at least one cation tracer. The potential of Eucalyptus trees to take up nutrients early, at long distance and at depth, can be promoted by silvicultural practices enhancing rapid root development after planting, as subsoiling in commercial plantations and large planting holes in smallholder plantations. Our results also suggest that fertilization could be applied only once at planting in Eucalyptus stands established on deep tropical soils, with low risks of nutrient losses by deep drainage. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Genetics, feeding system, geographic origin and climate influence the multielement profile of beef. The feasibility of combining classification algorithms with major and trace elements was evaluated as a tool for authentication of beef cuts. Methods: Animals of Angus, Nelore and Wagyu crossbreeds, raised in a vertically integrated system, were sampled at the slaughterhouse for chuck steak, rump cap and sirloin steak. Supervised learning algorithms i.e. Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF) and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) were used to build classification models based on the multielement profile of beef determined by neutron activation analysis. Results: Br, Co, Cs, Fe, K, Na, Rb, Se and Zn were determined in the beef samples. The classification accuracy values obtained for the beef cuts were 96% (MLP), 95% (SMO), 91% (RF), 86% (NB) and 70% (CART). Conclusion: The Multilayer Perceptron algorithm provided the best classification performance towards authentication of beef cuts on basis of major and trace element mass fractions. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH	Article	Scopus

The Kjeldahl method, the most usual for protein determination and a reference to other indirect methods, is time-consuming and generates significant amounts of waste. Aiming to circumvent these drawbacks, this work proposes a simple, cost-effective, and more environmental friendly procedure based on microdistillation of the ammonium from Kjeldahl digests, absorption on an acid-base indicator solution, and digital-image colorimetry for protein determination in food. Microdistillation was carried out in a simple and inexpensive lab-made apparatus. The digital images were acquired by a smartphone camera under controlled illumination and the intensity of the reflected radiation was converted to the RGB color system using a free app (PhotoMetrix®). Measurements were based on the color change of phenol red from yellow to pink and the G channel (corresponding to the complementary color of the dissociated indicator) was taken as analytical response. A linear response was achieved within 5.0–50.0 mg/L ammonium, equivalent to 0.003–0.03 % protein (r = 0.996), as confirmed by the lack-of-fit test at the 95 % confidence level. Coefficient of variation (n = 10) and limit of detection (99.7 % confidence level) were estimated at 2.3 % and 2 mg kg−1 protein, respectively. A sample throughput of 12 h−1 was achieved with simultaneous sample processing. Protein amounts determined in foods of animal (milk) and vegetal (beans and lentils) origin yielded results in agreement with the micro-Kjeldahl reference procedure at the 95 % confidence level. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Age-regulated microRNA156 (miR156) and gibberellins (GAs) interact to control flowering time, but their interplay in subsequent stages of reproductive development is poorly understood. Here, in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), we show that GA and miR156-targeted SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL or SBP) genes interact in the tomato FM and ovary patterning. High GA responses or overexpression of miR156 (156OE), which leads to low expression levels of miR156-silenced SBP genes, resulted in enlarged FMs, ovary indeterminacy and fruits with increased locule number. Conversely, low GA responses reduced indeterminacy and locule number, and overexpression of a S. lycopersicum (Sl)SBP15 allele that is miR156 resistant (rSBP15) reduced FM size and locule number. GA responses were partially required for the defects observed in 156OE and rSBP15 fruits. Transcriptome analysis and genetic interactions revealed shared and divergent functions of miR156-targeted SlSBP genes, PROCERA/DELLA and the classical WUSCHEL/CLAVATA pathway, which has been previously associated with meristem size and determinacy. Our findings reveal that the miR156/SlSBP/ GA regulatory module is deployed differently depending on developmental stage and create novel opportunities to fine-tune aspects of fruit development that have been important for tomato domestication. © 2023.

The bioconversion of vinasse to high-value products could represent an opportunity to reduce operating costs and environmental footprints. In this study, exopolysaccharides (EPSs) and fungal biomass were produced by different species of the genus Pleurotus (Pleurotus sajor-caju CCB 020, Pleurotus florida, Pleurotus ostreatoroseus, Pleurotus flabellatus, Pleurotus sp. CCB 068, and Pleurotus spleurotus) in submerged culture supplemented with different vinasse medium formulations. The highest yield of EPSs (about 7 g/L) was observed in the P. florida strain and the highest biomass in Pleurotus sp. CCB 068 with 28.8 g/L, after 14 days of fermentation. Results revealed that 100% vinasse is a suitable medium to achieve increased protein-rich biomass, exopolysaccharide content and minerals accumulation in the fungal biomass. Sugars predominant in the exopolysaccharide matrix were glucose, galactose, and mannose. Furthermore, the treatment of vinasse with Pleurotus provided efficient removal of color (98.8%) and turbidity (99%). The biomass following vinasse treatment can then be utilized for animal feed and human food supplementation, thus adding economic value to vinasse production.

In Brazil, extensive pastures are being converted to sugarcane crops to avoid deforestation, while the remaining pastures are being intensified to compensate for the loss of area. In this study, the hypothesis that conventional soil management practices conducted on intensive pasture and sugarcane crops increase the availability of contaminants in freshwater was tested. Thirteen mesocosms embedded in extensive pasture (EP), intensive pasture (IP), and sugarcane crops (C) systems were monitored for 392 days. The monitoring included the measurement of in situ parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, turbidity, and chlorophyll), nutrients (total nitrogen, nitrite, nitrate, ammonium ion, total phosphorus, total dissolved phosphorus, inorganic phosphorus, and silicate), and metals (aluminum, cadmium, copper, manganese, nickel, lead, potassium, and zinc). Soil management practices were performed in IP and C treatments at full-scale (tillage, application of fertilizers, vinasse and pesticides, and cattle pasture). The patterns observed for each treatment were obtained developing Principal Component Analysis over time. The mesocosms in the EP treatment did not experience large variations in water quality over time since no soil management was performed in this treatment. However, we found that fertilizer and vinasse application was the major precursor to the deterioration of water quality over time. After the first fertilizer application, we found eight and 16 times higher concentrations of total phosphorus, and seven and 45 times higher concentrations of total nitrogen in the IP and C treatments, respectively, in comparison to their concentration in the EP treatment. The application of vinasse in sugarcane crop increased water conductivity, potassium, and manganese concentrations in mesocosms. Dissolved oxygen and pH values decreased over time in all treatments. Overall, soil management practices resulted in greater deterioration of water quality in the sugarcane treatment than in the intensive pasture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Process-based approaches to predict the soil water status are advocated for an improved simulation of soil hydrology and crop yield. We investigated the sensitivity to system parameters in root water uptake simulation using a process-based function (MFlux) and an empirical function (Feddes) embedded in the SWAP hydrological model, applied to irrigated pasture scenarios in New Zealand. Data from two locations and three soils were used to simulate 42 growing seasons. The sensitivity analysis of both Feddes and MFlux parameters was performed for a rainfed and two irrigated scenarios, one triggering irrigation based on relative evapotranspiration (I–ETr), the other based on common practice using total available water (I–TAW). Results confirm that some parameters of the MFlux function are more sensitive than those from the Feddes function and both functions support the I–ETr criterion to optimize the water use in grazed pastures in New Zealand. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The lambs were randomly assigned to two experimental treatments: infected group (I) (n = 9) and control group (C) (n = 9). The lambs of group I were orally infected with 5000 T. colubriformis infective larvae (L3), three times per week during three weeks, totaling 45,000 L3. On the other hand, the lambs of group C remained uninfected. Each lamb was scanned 2x, the first scanning before the initial infection and the 2nd in the final of experimental period, with an interval of 90 days between measurements. For the analyses, the regions of the 4th and 12th ribs and thigh (femur) were selected, on the right side of the animal. The results showed that T. colubriformis infection reduced the bone density of growing lambs in the 4th rib (P = 0.0005), 12th rib region (P = <0.0001) and femur (P = 0.0063). Also, infected lambs had their bone density (4th rib, 12th rib and femur) reduced over time. We concluded that bone density in lambs was affected by Trichostrongylus colubriformis infection. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

There is a global demand for a practical and easy-to-use analytical tool capable of predicting the nutrient status of agricultural soils to make the soil chemical diagnosis faster, cheaper, and environmentally friendly. A growing body of research has highlighted the potential of energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) sensors for monitoring the condition of agricultural soils. This study critically reviews current knowledge on the feasibility of using XRF sensors and suggests ways forward to predict plant-available soil nutrients. The review finds that some challenges need to be addressed, including: (i) mitigating the matrix effect in XRF spectral libraries and (ii) calibrating models that can capture the local context of the ratio between total and available nutrient content (T/A ratio). This study further discusses knowledge gaps related to the abovementioned challenges and proposes the following future research areas: (i) understanding the impact of soil management on the temporal stability of T/A ratio and XRF model performance; (ii) assessing advanced predictive modelling strategies to address the challenges related to XRF spectral libraries, i.e., to deal with matrix effect and local context of the relationship between total and available content of nutrients, and (iii) evaluating data acquisition and modelling strategies that optimize the in situ application of portable XRF. Understanding these points is critical to advancing the technological maturity of predicting available nutrients in situ to fulfil plant nutrient requirements along with its development. Finally, portable, easy-to-use analytical tools are key to enhancing soil health/condition monitoring and proposing best management practices in agricultural areas worldwide, particularly in regions with limited infrastructure of soil laboratories. Soil monitoring is critical to preserve, sustain and recover soil condition/health, one of the main manageable drivers of soil and food security. © 2023	Review	Scopus

As an alternative, ‘point-based’ mapping of soil water content can improve global soil data availability and quality. We developed point-based global maps with estimated uncertainty of the volumetric SWR at 100, 330 and 15 000 cm suction using measured SWR data extracted from the WoSIS Soil Profile Database together with data estimated by a random forest PTF (PTF-RF). The point data was combined with around 200 environmental covariates describing vegetation, terrain morphology, climate, geology, and hydrology using DSM. In total, we used 7292, 33 192 and 42 016 SWR point observations at 100, 330 and 15 000 cm, respectively, and complemented the dataset with 436 108 estimated values at each suction. Tenfold cross-validation yielded a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.380, 7.112 and 6.485 10−2cm3cm−3, and a Model Efficiency Coefficient (MEC) of 0.430, 0.386, and 0.471, respectively, for 100, 330 and 15 000 cm. The results were also compared to three published global maps of SWR to evaluate differences between point-based and map-based mapping approaches. Point-based mapping performed better than the three map-based mapping approaches for 330 and 15 000 cm, while for 100 cm results were similar, possibly due to the limited number of SWR observations for 100 cm. Major sources or uncertainty identified included the geographical clustering of the data and the limitation of the covariates to represent the naturally high variation of SWR. © 2022 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water and Power Press, and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research	Article	Scopus

Innovative technologies are required to reduce the risk generated by the extensive and harmful use of pesticides. The plant biostimulants made from humic substances isolated from recyclable biomass offer an alternative approach to address the need for replacing conventional agrochemicals without compromising the crop yield. The stimulatory effects of humic substances are commonly associated with plant hormones, particularly auxins. However, jasmonic acid (JA) is crucial metabolite in mediating the defence responses and governing plant growth and development. This work aimed to evaluate the changes in the biosynthesis and signalling pathway of JA in tomato seedlings treated with humic acids (HA) isolated from vermicompost. We use the tomato model system cultivar Micro-Tom (MT) harbouring a reporter gene fused to a synthetic promoter that responds to jasmonic acid (JERE::GUS). The transcript levels of genes involved in JA generation and activity were also determined using qRT-PCR. The application of HA promoted plant growth and altered the JA status, as revealed by both GUS and qRT-PCR assays. Both JA enzymatic synthesis (LOX, OPR3) and JA signalling genes (JAZ and JAR) were found in higher transcription levels in plants treated with HA. In addition, ethylene (ETR4) and auxin (ARF6) signalling components were positively modulated by HA, revealing a hormonal cross-talk. Our results prove that the plant defence system linked to JA can be emulated by HA application without growth inhibition. © 2023 by the authors.	Article	Scopus

Storage protein biosynthesis does not follow a linear progression from the beginning of seed filling (R5.1) until the full maturity (R8) stage, whereas it is accompanied by sulfur and magnesium demand peaks. Globulin concentration was consistently higher than the albumins at all developmental stages and reached an accumulation peak in the R6 stage.

However, land use change and long-term conventional sugarcane cultivation have degraded entire watersheds, including a substantial loss of soil multifunctionality. In our study, riparian zones have been reforested to mitigate these impacts, protect aquatic ecosystems, and restore ecological corridors within the sugarcane production landscapes. We examined (i) how forest restoration enables rehabilitation of the soil's multifunctionality after long-term sugarcane cultivation and (ii) how long it takes to regain ecosystem functions comparable to those of a primary forest. We investigated a time series of riparian forests at 6, 15, and 30 years after starting restoration by planting trees (named ‘active restoration’) and determined soil C stocks, δ13C (indicative of C origin), as well as measures indicative of soil health. A primary forest and a long-term sugarcane field were used as references. Eleven soil physical, chemical, and biological indicators were used for a structured soil health assessment, calculating index scores based on soil functions. Forest-to-cane conversion reduced 30.6 Mg ha−1 of soil C stocks, causing soil compaction and loss of cation exchange capacity, thus degrading soil's physical, chemical, and biological functions. Forest restoration for 6–30 years recovered 16–20 Mg C ha−1 stored in soils. In all restored sites, soil functions such as supporting root growth, aerating the soil, nutrient storage capacity, and providing C energy for microbial activity were gradually recovered. Thirty years of active restoration was sufficient to reach the primary forest state in overall soil health index, multifunctional performance, and C sequestration. We conclude that active forest restoration in sugarcane-dominated landscapes is an effective way to restore soil multifunctionality approaching the level of the native forest in approximately three decades. Moreover, the C sequestration in the restored forest soils will help to mediate global warming. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

These toxins pose significant risks to public health and the environment, making it critical to identify and quantify them in food and water sources to avoid contamination. However, current screening methods only focus on a single class of cyanotoxins, limiting their effectiveness. Thus, fast and sensitive liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed to analyze eighteen cyanotoxins simultaneously. A simplified extraction procedure using lyophilized samples of cyanobacterial biomass was also used, eliminating the need for traditional solid-phase extraction methods. This method uses multiple reaction monitoring and allows accurate determination and quantification of eighteen cyanotoxins, including anatoxin-a, homoanatoxin-a, cylindrospermopsin, deoxy-cylindrospermopsin, nodularin, guanitoxin, seven microcystins (RR, [D-Asp3] RR, LA, LR, LY, LW, and YR), and five saxitoxins (gonyautoxins - GTX-1&4, GTX-2&3, GTX-5), decarbamoylgonyautoxin (dcGTX-2&3), and N-Sulfocarbamoylgonyautoxin (C1&C2), all in a short acquisition time of 8 min. Therefore, this method provides a simple and efficient approach to identify and quantify harmful compounds produced by cyanobacteria. Hence, this represents the first method to detecting guanitoxin among cyanotoxins. By expanding the range of toxins analyzed, this method can help ensure high-quality food and drinking water and protect recreational users from exposure to cyanotoxins. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Derivatization was performed by means of the reaction between Al(III) and Alizarin Red S (ARS) reagent. Digital images were acquired using a table scanner and the average values for red, green and blue channels (RGB) were obtained. Optimal conditions were set at pH=4.5, ARS concentrations 10-fold higher than Al(III) and using the G channel. The method presented linearity in the 2.0–10.0 mg L−1 range, the limit of detection (LOD) was 1.1 mg L−1 and precision was better than 2.55 %. Accuracy was checked by the analysis of spiked samples at 2.0 and 4.0 mg L−1 Al(III), and good recoveries (82.6–117.5 %) were obtained. Eight samples of roll-on antiperspirants were analyzed by the proposed colorimetric method and the well-stablished flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) comparative method. The obtained results were not statistically different at 95 % confidence level. An analytical greenness assessment was performed for both methods and the procedure based on digital image colorimetry was proven to be a greener approach due to miniaturization, low sample consumption, least amount of waste and high sample throughput. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

K(ψ)Model is derived solely from hydraulic parameters describing a bimodal, lognormal, pore-scale, soil water retention curve θ(ψ). The K(ψ)Model is based on the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which represents the soil as a bundle of parallel, non-intersecting capillary tubes. To improve the modelling of fine-textured soils we introduced a novel model to consider the clay-water interaction. This model assumes that clay-water interaction occurs for soils having more than 30% of clay and an effective matrix porosity greater than 35%. Compared to previously developed models, the K(ψ)Model does not require the use of integrals and can be computed from a spreadsheet and distinguishes between macropore (non-equilibrium) and matrix (equilibrium) flows. The K(ψ)Model gives improved results when the hydraulic parameters are dynamically constrained and when θ(ψ) describes a bimodal, lognormal distribution. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Here, we investigated the role of endogenous NO in shaping shoot architecture and controlling fruit set and growth in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). SlGSNOR silencing promoted shoot side branching and led to reduced fruit size, negatively impacting fruit yield. Greatly intensified in slgsnor knockout plants, these phenotypical changes were virtually unaffected by SlGSNOR overexpression. Silencing or knocking out of SlGSNOR intensified protein tyrosine nitration and S-nitrosation and led to aberrant auxin production and signaling in leaf primordia and fruit-setting ovaries, besides restricting the shoot basipetal polar auxin transport stream. SlGSNOR deficiency triggered extensive transcriptional reprogramming at early fruit development, reducing pericarp cell proliferation due to restrictions on auxin, gibberellin, and cytokinin production and signaling. Abnormal chloroplast development and carbon metabolism were also detected in early-developing NO-overaccumulating fruits, possibly limiting energy supply and building blocks for fruit growth. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which endogenous NO fine-tunes the delicate hormonal network controlling shoot architecture, fruit set, and post-anthesis fruit development, emphasizing the relevance of NO-auxin interaction for plant development and productivity.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Eucalyptus tereticornis is frequently cultivated in such soils. We investigated the effects of Mn in E. tereticornis under contrasting soil P availability and hypothesized that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis could alleviate Mn toxicity by improving P nutrition and altering the expression of Mn transporter genes. Methods: Inoculated (AM) and non-inoculated (NM) seedlings grew for seven months in a soil with low or sufficient P availability, under three Mn doses: control, 75 and 150 mg kg−1 Mn. We assessed growth, AM colonization, nutrient concentrations, and the expression of eight genes related to Mn transport and homeostasis in roots. Mn distribution at one-leaf level was determined by μ-XRF. Results: Low P exacerbated Mn toxicity and hindered plant growth. Mycorrhizal symbiosis did not influence Mn accumulation, but improved growth and Mn tolerance at low P, partly by improving P nutrition. At sufficient P, foliar Mn reached 3500 mg kg−1, and μ-XRF patterns suggest preferential accumulation in the leaf lamina compared to margins or midribs. In NM plants, the vacuolar transporters EtVIT1 and EtMTP8 and the Mn-nicotianamine influx transporter EtYSL6 were the most responsive genes to Mn, while in AM roots most were downregulated. Conclusion: Vacuolar sequestration and transport of complexed Mn are important mechanisms behind Mn tolerance in E. tereticornis. We propose that Mn is transported via the mycorrhizal pathway, explaining why it does not elicit the same molecular response observed in NM roots. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Purine derivates excretion is used to estimate microbial protein synthesis and could be used to estimate DMI. The present study aimed to evaluate PD models to estimate DMI and digestible DMI and access endogenous excretion of PD using regression analysis. Nine trials and 158 experimental units (animal or animal within the period) where DMI, dry matter apparent digestibility (n = 122), and PD urinary excretion were evaluated. Models were evaluated using PROC MIXED of SAS and considering the random effect of the trial. The PDC index was the better single variable to estimate sheep DMI. More complex models considering PD to creatinine ratio and metabolic weight (BW0.75) showed the lowest error. Quadratic terms of PDC index, PD: creatinine ratio, and allantoin to creatinine ratio did not improve DMI estimation. Similar results were observed comparing different models to estimate digestible DMI, however, with lower R2. In addition, endogenous excretion of PD estimated by linear regression was 0.286 mmol/kg of BW0.75. Thus, the PDC index is the best variable to estimate feed intake and digestible DMI from PD excretion. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

This work aimed to evaluate the putative resistance of the Amaranthus hybridus population from Candido Mota (CMT) to glyphosate and imazethapyr and to investigate the non-target site mechanisms involved. Dose–response studies were conducted under greenhouse conditions and the control and biomass reduction were evaluated 28 days after application (DAA). Absorption, translocation, and metabolization studies were evaluated at 72 h after treatment (HAT) using radiometric techniques. The dose–response results show different responses among populations to glyphosate and imazethapyr. The CMT population was not controlled with labeled herbicide doses. Based on biomass reduction, the resistance factor was 16.4 and 9.4 to glyphosate and imazethapyr, respectively. The CMT absorbed 66% of 14C-glyphosate and 23% of 14C-imazethapyr at 72 HAT. Although the CMT population absorbed more glyphosate than the susceptible population (12.6%), translocation was impaired for both herbicides in the CMT when compared to the SUS population. There was no evidence that herbicide metabolization was involved in CMT resistance to the herbicides studied. Understanding the mechanisms endowing resistance allows better decision-making. This is the first study that describes non-target-site resistance mechanisms in an Amaranthus hybridus population from Brazil. © 2023 by the authors.	Article	Scopus

Here, we traced the origins of cupuaçu (Theobroma grandiflorum), an Amazonian tree crop closely related to cacao (T. cacao), cherished for its flavorful seed-pulp, by employing an extensive genomic analysis based on data from four sites in Brazil. Our results indicate that cupuaçu is a domesticated variant of its wild relative, cupuí (T. subincanum), probably originating from the Middle-Upper Rio Negro basin. A first phase of domestication is observed through a genetic bottleneck that we estimated to have occurred 5000–8000 years before the present. Moreover, we found further reductions in genetic diversity that we estimated to have occurred during the modern era. This is consistent with a second phase of domestication that was accompanied by an increase in the geographic distribution of cupuaçu over the last two centuries. Unraveling cupuaçu’s origins adds it to the roster of plants domesticated by Amazonian indigenous people in the early to mid-Holocene. Our results suggest that Amazonia’s current patterns of genetic diversity and distribution of domesticated plants were influenced by both pre-Columbian and modern histories. © 2023, The Author(s).

We evaluated the combination of limonene (LIM), a P-glycoprotein (Pgp) modulator, with IVM in lambs infected with a multidrug-resistant H. contortus. Twenty-four male Dorper lambs were artificially infected with two doses (seven days apart) of 8000 infective larvae of a multidrug-resistant isolate of H. contortus. The infection was patent 25 days later. Fifteen days before treatment with IVM (DAY –15), animals were divided into 4 groups: Infected-untreated control (CTL), IVM, LIM, and LIM+IVM. From DAY –15 to DAY + 14, groups LIM and LIM+IVM received 200 mg/kg of body weight/day of LIM via oral. On DAY 0, a single dose of IVM at 200 µg/kg of body weight was administered orally to groups IVM and LIM+IVM. On DAY + 7 and DAY + 14, fecal egg counts (FEC) were performed and on DAY + 14 animals were euthanized for total worm count (TWC), worm length, fecundity of females, and Pgp-9 gene expression. On DAY + 7, group LIM+IVM had 96.29% efficacy based on Fecal Egg Count Reduction TEST (FECRT) and a highly significant reduction in FEC (P = 0.0005) when compared to CTL. On DAY + 14, the efficacy of LIM+IVM was 82.87% on FECRT, although no differences were found among groups for FEC, TWC, worm length, or Pgp-9 gene expression. Female worms from the CTL group had higher egg counts in their uterus when compared to LIM. No differences were found for hematological or biochemical parameters, body weight, or weight gain among groups. Thus, LIM given daily at 200 mg/kg was safe for animals and, when combined with IVM, decreased egg shedding and could reduce pasture contamination, although it was unable to kill multidrug-resistant H. contortus. © 2023	Article	Scopus

Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.) A. Gray (TD) has already gained attention as a feed for ruminants. Nonetheless, there has been little discussion about the impacts of this plant on the rumen dynamics that lead to better animal performance. The aim of this study was to assess how increasing levels of TD could affect ruminal microbial biomass synthesis, degradability, and in vitro gas production (IVGP) of diets. Four diets were evaluated: a control diet (TD0: 400 g kg−1 soybean meal and maize grain, and 600 g kg−1 Tifton 85 hay (Cynodon spp.)) and three increasing levels of TD (TD9: 90, TD27: 270, and TD45: 450 g kg−1–dry matter basis) as a replacement for dietary roughage. A 96 h IVGP assay was carried out and five incubation times (2, 4, 10, 24, and 96 h) were used for degradability determination. Gas produced, methane (CH4), degradability of organic matter (IVDOM), short-chained fatty acid (SCFA) production, partitioning factor (PF), and microbial biomass (MB) were evaluated among treatments. There was no significant effect (p > 0.05) between TD inclusion and IVGP at most incubation times; only at 6 h of incubation did gas production increase linearly with TD inclusion (R2 = 0.19; p < 0.05). TD inclusion had no effects on CH4. IVDOM increased linearly with TD inclusion at 6 and 10 h, with TD45 being more degradable than the control diet at 6 h only. There was a positive linear relationship (R2 = 0.20; p < 0.05) between TD inclusion and PF. TD45 had significantly higher PF values than the control. MB also increased linearly (R2 = 0.30; p < 0.05) with TD inclusion, and all diets with TD had significantly more MB than the control diet. The inclusion of TD at the levels used in this work was revealed to have a positive impact on microbial protein synthesis, which could be related to the higher microbial efficiency of increased substrate quality. © 2023 by the authors.

Formaldehyde in milk is generally determined after microdistillation or protein precipitation steps. Commonly employed chromatographic methods for formaldehyde determination in milk generate high amounts of hazardous waste; however, the waste generation and reagent consumption can be easily minimized by non-chromatographic methods and sample processing in flow-based systems. In this work, a flow analysis system is proposed for online protein precipitation followed by continuous spectrophotometric determination of formaldehyde in milk. After precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and filtration, three portions of the extract were separately mixed with the colorimetric reagent. The detection limit was estimated at 0.45 mg L−1, which is lower than the recommended maximum content of formaldehyde in foods. After 51 determinations, the filtration unit was cleaned and was used for further analysis. Recoveries between 80% and 119% were obtained for whole milk, skimmed milk, and lactose-free whole milk sample that showed higher content of proteins owing to the presence of lactase. Herein, we propose a fast and reliable alternative for milk sample preparation and formaldehyde determination. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.	Article	Scopus

Flavonols, a class of natural compounds with many benefits to human health, are commonly determined by spectrophotometry and chromatography, often generating large amounts of harmful wastes. Besides, the spectrophotometric methods are typically not selective, with interferences from anthocyanins and phenolic acids. To circumvent these drawbacks, this work proposes a cost-effective and environmental friendly spot test associated with liquid–liquid microextraction for determination of flavonols in berries by digital-image photometry. Flavonols were extracted from berries with ethanol and further separated from anthocyanins by ethyl acetate salt-assisted microextraction. After formation of colored Al(III)-flavonol complexes, digital images were obtained in a porcelain plate using a smartphone camera. The RGB values were extracted using ImageJ® software, and channel B was taken for photometric measurements. A linear response was achieved within 0.33–5.00 mg/L (1–17 µmol/L) quercetin equivalent concentration (QE) with r ≥ 0.997. The coefficient of variation (n = 10) and limit of detection were estimated at 3.9% and 0.1 mg/L QE (0.3 µmol/L), respectively. The accuracy was assessed by comparison to the spectrophotometric procedure, with results in agreement at the 95% confidence level. The proposed procedure minimized reagent/solvent consumption (70 µg of Al(III), 142 mg of Na2SO4, equivalent to 9.2 µL of HCl, and 2.0 mL of ethyl acetate) and the waste generated is mostly composed by water and ethanol. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, the aim of the present study was to investigate how electron beam irradiation (EBI) applied at doses between 1 and 10 kGy affect intracellular and extracellular microcystin variants. Effects on M. aeruginosa culture recovery, as well as changes in physico-chemical cyanobacterial suspension parameters and water quality alterations were assessed through ecotoxicity assays. The findings indicate that doses over 2 kGy may are lethal to M. aeruginosa even at 48 h post-irradiation. Concerning physico-chemical parameters, exposure to 2–5 kGy doses decrease pH values and later stabilizing. At least 50 % of intracellular MC led to significant degradation of all variants at 3 kGy. No acute toxicity effects were observed in Daphnia similis exposed to sample supernatants. Statistically significant differences were observed when cladocerans were exposed to M. aeruginosa cells treated with EBI doses ranging from 3 to 10 kGy compared to non-treated cyanobacterial suspensions. These findings suggest that low EBI radiation doses are suitable for the control of toxic cyanobacteria in water treatment processes, providing a less toxic environment compared to non-treated solutions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies have shown the advantages of adopting water-saving irrigation in the region but a comprehensive assessment is needed. This study aims to model the performance of rice cultivation and water productivity in the tropical floodplains of the Cerrado biome of northern Brazil in response to irrigation management under contrasting seasonal rainfall levels. Twenty-seven scenarios of rice cultivation, resulting from the combination of three sites, three irrigation treatments, and three rainfall regimes, were simulated with the calibrated and validated hydrological model SWAP/WOFOST. The rainfall levels high (1501 mm), intermediate (952 mm), and low (510 mm) were relative to 120 days and obtained from weather stations located in the region. Two irrigation methods (flooding and water-saving irrigation) were compared against rainfed cultivation. Actual transpiration of the flooding and water-saving irrigation was 9 % and 4 % higher in the intermediate and high rainfall scenarios while it was 30 % and 20 % higher in the low rainfall scenario compared to the rainfed treatment. The largest deep percolation loss was 12700 mm per season for flood irrigation in the low rainfall scenario, whereas the lowest one was 349 mm for the rainfed treatment in the low rainfall scenario. Changing from flooding to water-saving irrigation increases water productivity by an average of 9 % and decreases relative grain yield by 5–12 %. Water productivity based on bottom flux increased on average by about five times (high rainfall scenario) to ten times (low rainfall scenario) when comparing flooding with water-saving irrigation. Results suggest that saving irrigation based on crop transpiration can reduce deep percolation losses and increase water productivity in the rice-growing areas of the Brazilian Cerrado. © 2023 The Authors	Article	Scopus

However, its direct measurement is laborious and spatial interpretation is complex. Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques emerge as an alternative to spatial modeling of soil properties. DSM techniques commonly apply machine learning (ML) models, with a high level of complexity. In this context, we aimed to perform a digital mapping of soil AWC and interpret the results of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm and, in a case study, to show that digital AWC maps can support agricultural planning in response to the local effects of climate change. To do so, we divided this research into two approaches: In the first approach, we showed a DSM using 1857 sample points in a southeastern region of Brazil with laboratory-determined soil attributes, together with a pedotransfer function (PTF), remote sensing and DSM techniques. In the second approach, the constructed AWC digital soil map and weather station data were used to calculate climatological soil water balances for the periods between 1917–1946 and 1991–2020. The result showed the selection of covariates using Shapley values as a criterion contributed to the parsimony of the model, obtaining goodness-of-fit metrics of R2 0.72, RMSE 16.72 mm m−1, CCC 0.83, and Bias of 0.53 over the validation set. The highest contributing covariates for soil AWC prediction were the Landsat multitemporal images with bare soil pixels, mean diurnal, and annual temperature range. Under the current climate conditions, soil available water content (AW) increased during the dry period (April to August). May had the highest increase in AW (∼17 mm m−1) and decrease in September (∼14 mm m−1). The used methodology provides support for AWC modeling at 30 m resolution, as well as insight into the adaptation of crop growth periods to the effects of climate change. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

A guide for analysis by the proposed approach is provided and validated. The approach is more environmentally friendly and cost-effective, reducing the cost of implementation by avoiding the need for large data sets of samples analyzed by costly and laborious reference analytical methods. The combination of multivariate techniques (principal components analysis, PCA, alternating least-squares multivariate curve resolution, MCR-ALS, and partial least squares regression, PLS) with visual spectra inspection and spectral correlation yielded consistent qualitative and quantitative results. As a case study, the approach was applied to commercial bulk sweeteners commonly used in low carbohydrate diet (erythritol and xylitol) and non-conformities detection was feasible using few reference samples which were not analyzed by conventional analytical methods. The effect of particle size of commercial products and their mixtures on the NIR spectrum as well as the non-linear spectral response observed for binary mixtures of sweeteners are discussed. Mixtures of sweeteners, simulating product adulterations, were analyzed using PCA, non-linear MCR-ALS, and PLS, to evidence non-conformity of commercial products and to estimate the level of adulteration. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Designing the recycling process requires accurate determination of the elements in the leachates, which is hindered by the high complexity of the matrix. In the present study, microwave-induced plasma atomic emission spectrometry (MIP-OES) was selected as the quantitative method for elemental analysis because of its environment friendliness and cost-effectiveness. Multi-energy calibration (MEC) was also pioneeringly evaluated to circumvent matrix effects and simplify the determination of Ce, La, Ni, Co, and Mn in sulfuric acid leachates of NiMH batteries by MIP-OES. The method's analytical performance and accuracy were critically compared with external standard calibration and the standard additions method. MEC yielded superior results, with analyte recoveries within 90-110%, precision (coefficients of variation) from 1.8% to 5.8%, and limits of detection of 10, 20, 1, 400, and 60 μg kg−1 for Ni, La, Mn, Ce, and Co, respectively. The results demonstrated the ability of MEC-MIP-OES to minimize matrix effects, as well as simplify and speed up the analysis of NiMH battery leachates, which is compatible with this high-demand analytical application. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

However, few studies have reported the effect of N application in soil amended with organic compost in the long-term on soil microbial communities. This study assessed the responses of bacterial and archaeal communities to N application in soil with a long-term amendment of organic compost obtained from tannery sludge. The application of high and low rates of compost increased the abundance of Actinobacteria and Thaumarchaeota, respectively, while the application of N did not change the relative abundance of bacterial and archaeal groups. The long-term application of compost promoted an increased abundance of specific bacterial groups, including Solirubrobacter, Microvirga, and Geodermatophilus. Regardless of the application of N, higher microbial complexity and interconnection were observed with the application of compost. This study showed a small effect of N fertilization on the microbial community, which suggests that N may not be a limiting factor for microorganisms in soil under long-term amendment of organic compost. Our findings showed that compost application has a stronger impact on soil microbial communities than N fertilization, and it could be useful in agricultural productivity. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH	Article	Scopus

Cysteine and methionine are sulfur-containing essential amino acids used for bacterial growth and the Lxx titer in sugar cane leaves could affect the animo acid concentrations. The goal of this study was to evaluate how the increase in Lxx titer affects the nutritional status and sulfur metabolism in sugar cane leaves. Methods: Susceptible sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum) genotype: CB49260 was used in this study with low (256 cells) and high (2090 cells) Lxx titers and macronutrients and primary metabolites assessed from leaves and culms. Results: Plants with high Lxx titers accumulated more biomass in the main culm, leaves, and shoots than plants with low Lxx titers. Additionally, plants with high Lxx titers had 26% more sulfur content in leaves than plants with low Lxx titers. Higher levels of sulfate, sucrose, maltose, raffinose, shikimic acid, malate, putrescine, glycerol, and, erythritol were also present in plants with high Lxx titers; but decreased levels of methionine and glutathione in leaves. In the culm, plants with high Lxx titers also had increased levels of maltose; but decreased levels of threonine, ornithine, phenylalanine and myo-inositol when compared with plants with low Lxx titers. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that high bacterial titers increase sulfur demand in sugar cane; however, the increased S content in the leaf did not result in higher sulfur assimilation, verified by increased sulfate but decreased methionine and glutathione levels. Therefore, our study showed that lower methionine availability, and methionine catabolism to putrescine in the leaves may fail to meet the increased sulfur organic compound demand of Lxx. The decrease in glutathione biosynthesis may reflect impaired biosynthesis or a drain on this antioxidant resulting from oxidative stresss by pathogenesis of Lxx. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

However, incomplete information on C storage in restored tropical forests often fails to capture the ecosystem's holistic C dynamics. This study provides an integrated assessment of C storage in above to belowground subsystems, its consequences for greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, and the quantity, quality, and origin of soil organic matter (SOM) in restored Atlantic forests in Brazil. Relations between SOM properties and soil health indicators were also explored. We examined two restorations using tree planting (‘active restoration’): an 8-year-old forest with green manure and native trees planted in two rounds, and a 15-year-old forest with native-planted trees in one round without green manure. Restorations were compared to reformed pasture and primary forest sites. We measured C storage in soil layers (0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm), litter, and plants. GHG emissions were assessed using CH4 and CO2 fluxes. SOM quantity was evaluated using C and N, quality using humification index (HLIFS), and origin using δ13C and δ15N. Nine soil health indicators were interrelated with SOM attributes. The primary forest presented the highest C stocks (107.7 Mg C ha−1), followed by 15- and 8-year-old restorations and pasture with 69.8, 55.5, and 41.8 Mg C ha−1, respectively. Soil C stocks from restorations and pasture were 20% lower than primary forest. However, 8- and 15-year-old restorations stored 12.3 and 28.3 Mg ha−1 more aboveground C than pasture. The younger forest had δ13C and δ15N values of 2.1 and 1.7‰, respectively, lower than the 15-year-old forest, indicating more C derived from C3 plants and biological N fixation. Both restorations and pasture had at least 34% higher HLIFS in deeper soil layers (10–30 cm) than primary forest, indicating a lack of labile SOM. Native and 15-year-old forests exhibited higher soil methane influx (141.1 and 61.9 μg m−2 h−1). Forests outperformed pasture in most soil health indicators, with 69% of their variance explained by SOM properties. However, SOM quantity and quality regeneration in both restorations approached the pristine forest state only in the top 10 cm layer, while deeper soil retained agricultural degradation legacies. In conclusion, active restoration of the Atlantic Forest is a superior approach compared to pasture reform for GHG mitigation. Nonetheless, the development of restoration techniques to facilitate labile C input into deeper soil layers (>10 cm) is needed to further improve soil multifunctionality and long-term C storage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

First described in Brazil, it has since spread to become a globally important pathogen that infects more than 480 myrtaceous species. One of the most important commercial crops affected by A. psidii is eucalypt, a widely grown forestry tree. The A. psidii–Eucalyptus spp. interaction is poorly understood, but pathogenesis is likely driven by pathogen-secreted effector molecules. Here, we identified and characterized a total of 255 virulence effector candidates using a genome assembly of A. psidii strain MF-1, which was recovered from Eucalyptus grandis in Brazil. We show that the expression of seven effector candidate genes is modulated by cell wax from leaves sourced from resistant and susceptible hosts. Two effector candidates with different subcellular localization predictions, and with specific gene expression profiles, were transiently expressed with GFP-fusions in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Interestingly, we observed the accumulation of an effector candidate, Ap28303, which was upregulated under cell wax from rust susceptible E. grandis and described as a peptidase inhibitor I9 domain-containing protein in the nucleus. This was in accordance with in silico analyses. Few studies have characterized nuclear effectors. Our findings open new perspectives on the study of A. psidii–Eucalyptus interactions by providing a potential entry point to understand how the pathogen manipulates its hosts in modulating physiology, structure, or function with effector proteins. © 2023 by the authors.

While tomato is a plant with the C3 photosynthetic metabolism, sugarcane is a tropical grass with C4 photosynthesis, used in Brazil as feedstock for sugar and alcohol vinegar production. Sugarcane derivatives are often widely used in the Brazilian food industry. In this paper, we investigated the relative isotopic proportion of C3 and C4-derived products in 25 ketchup brands commercialized in Brazil, through the carbon (C) isotopic ratio (δ13C). The aim was to identify the contribution of tomatoes to the final ketchup composition, as the manufacturers do not provide this information to the consumer. The overall δ13C mean in the analyzed ketchup was –16.2 ± 1.4 ‰, suggesting a predominance of C4- over C3-derived sources in these brands. Using a Bayesian isotopic dilution model, we estimated that approximately 75 % of the carbon source of ketchup comes from C4 plants (p < 0.05). A low correlation between ketchup price and δ13C was found, probably because price reflects attributes such as brand and, not necessarily, product composition. In addition, our study also presents a robust regressive predictive model of the sugar percentages in the final ketchup composition. Combining these approaches, consistent tools can be incorporated to evaluate ketchup quality. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.	Article	Scopus

While RBS have potential for carbon sequestration, they also can be sources of methane emissions. Our study site at Washington Creek in Southern Ontario, includes a rehabilitated tree buffer (RH), a grassed buffer (GRB), an undisturbed deciduous forest (UNF), an undisturbed coniferous forest (CF), and an adjacent agricultural field (AGR). The objective of this study was to assess the diversity and activity of CH4 cycling microbial communities in soils sampled during hot moments of methane fluxes (July 04 and August 15). We used qPCR and high-throughput amplicon sequencing from both DNA and cDNA to target methanogen and methanotroph communities. Methanogens, including the archaeal genera Methanosaeta, Methanosarcina, Methanomassiliicoccus, and Methanoreggula, were abundant in all RBSs, but they were significantly more active in UNF soils, where CH4 emissions were highest. Methylocystis was the most prevalent taxon among methanotrophs in all the riparian sites, except for AGR soils where the methanotrophs community was composed primarily of members of rice paddy clusters (RPCs and RPC-1) and upland soil clusters (TUSC and USCα). The main factors influencing the composition and assembly of methane-cycling microbiomes were soil carbon and moisture content. We concluded that the differences in CH4 fluxes observed between RBSs were primarily caused by differences in the presence and activity of methanogens, which were influenced by total soil carbon and water content. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of understanding the microbial drivers of CH4 fluxes in RBSs in order to maximize RBS environmental benefits. © 2023	Article	Scopus

Its solution requires knowledge of the soil hydraulic properties (SHP): the soil water retention function and the hydraulic conductivity function. To determine SHP, laboratory evaporation experiments are particularly popular because they provide data for both SHP functions. The evaluation by the simplified evaporation method (SEM) method, originally proposed by Schindler and subsequently improved by several authors, relies on linearization assumptions that allow for a relatively simple calculation scheme but result in biased conductivity data for some soils. The objective of this study is to propose and test an improved computational scheme for the hydraulic conductivity function. We present the new theory and show that it leads generally to higher accuracy of the conductivity function. The improvement is most pronounced for sandy soils and soil water pressure heads below −100 cm, where the original method provided data with bias. © 2023 The Authors.

However, limited information exists regarding the effectiveness of FNf in sugarcane. This study aimed to optimize FNf in sugarcane by evaluating N-fertilizer recovery by the plant (NRP) and assessing potential toxicity effects. Four sugarcane genotypes were subjected to FNf using 15N-urea at five nitrogen concentrations. NRP was assessed at five time points for roots, stalk, old leaves, 15N-urea-fertilized leaves (15NL), and unexpanded leaves (UEL). Leaf scorching, indicating FNf toxicity, was analyzed using morpho-anatomical and histochemical techniques. The results showed that FNf promoted high NRP, with an average recovery of 62.3%. Surprisingly, the redistribution of 15N-urea did not follow the nitrogen uptake rate by sugarcane leaves, with an average of 41.3% of the total-NRP. The stalk emerged as the primary sink for 15N-urea, followed by the UEL. Genotypes differed in the leaf scorching intensity, which increased with higher concentration of 15N-urea. Genotypes also differed in the 15N-urea uptake rate, down-regulated by the N content in the 15NL. These findings emphasize that by carefully choosing the appropriate genotype and nitrogen concentration, FNf can significantly enhance N-fertilizer uptake, resulting in potential environmental and economic benefits. © 2023 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society.

Several studies have shown some genes as potential biological markers for sheep resistance against gastrointestinal nematodes using molecular tools, including transcriptomic analysis. In this study, we sequenced the polyadenylated RNA of the abomasal tissue of SI and IF suckling lambs to identify mucosa-specific transcript alterations between breeds artificially infected with H. contortus. Naïve SI (n = 4) and IF (n = 4) lambs were artificially infected every other day, over a period of 52 days, from 14 to 66 days old, with a total of 5,400 H. contortus infective larvae. Fundic abomasal tissue samples were collected at 68 days old, and submitted to high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Differential expression analysis (P value < 0.001 and False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05) between SI and IF samples identified 292 genes, most of which showed greater expression in SI lambs. To help annotate and assign possible function to differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we used previously available single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from ovine abomasal mucosa to putatively identify cell types and possible mechanisms involved in resistance to H. contortus. In particular, genes associated with endothelial and tuft cells showed the greatest increases in expression in SI relative to IF lambs. SI lambs had higher percentages of tuft cells than IF lambs in the fundic abomasal mucosa. Although we found innate immunity (cell-mediated in mucosa) acting as a protagonist in impairing H. contortus infection, a stronger acquired immune response was being modulated at an earlier stage by SI lambs. We suggest that the complex connection between innate and adaptive immunity is via cellular antigen processing and presentation (APP). Based on comparison with scRNA-seq data, SI lambs showed a robust APP mechanism characterized mainly by greater T cell APP, macrophage differentiation, and cytokine signalling. We identified potential mechanisms and markers to advance knowledge for selection of H. contortus resistance at a very early age, in SI as well as in other commercial sheep breeds. © 2023 Australian Society for Parasitology	Article	Scopus

However, it remains unclear how domestication shapes the community of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) in the rhizosphere. Therefore, this study assessed the PGPB community during the domestication of lima bean. Soil samples from the rhizosphere of wild, semi-domesticated, and domesticated genotypes were collected, and the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to identify PGPB genera. The domestication of lima beans did not impact the diversity of PGPB in the rhizosphere. However, the composition of the PGPB community changed when comparing wild, semi-domesticated, and domesticated genotypes. The network complexity increased from wild to domesticated genotypes, and the process of domestication increased the proportion of generalists and specialist PGPB. This study demonstrated that the domestication of lima bean shapes the composition and interactions of PGPB in the rhizosphere.

In the environment, these drugs can be bioaccumulated by organisms and transferred along the food chain. This is a problem when considering the consumption of fish meat. In the United States, legislation stipulates that the maximum residue limit for sulfadiazine (SDZ) should not exceed 100 μg kg−1. Lambari fishes have potential economic importance in aquaculture, as they are relatively easy to breed and can be raised in small-scale operations. Finally, studying the biology and ecology of lambari could provide valuable information about freshwater ecosystems and their inhabitants. The current work aimed to measure the bioaccumulation and depletion of the antibiotic SDZ 14C in lambari (Astyanax bimaculatus). For this purpose, the tests were divided into two stages; seven days of exposure and seven days of depletion, where one fish was randomly selected and sampled every day. In the exposure phase, the fish were fed the medicated feed three times a day at a concentration of 2.5 mg·g−1. The control fish were fed uncontaminated feed. For the depletion phase, the remaining lambari were transferred to clean tanks and fed uncontaminated feed three times a day. The fish samples were burned in the Oxidizer and the reading of radioactivity was performed in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. It is worth noting that on day 7 and day 14, the water in the aquariums was filtered through filter paper to collect the metabolic excrement. SDZ concentrations increased over the days and accumulation occurred in the fish, with day seven presenting the maximum accumulation value of 91.7 ng·g−1 due to feeding uptake. After the depletion phase on day 13, the value found was 0.83 ng·g−1. The bioconcentration factor calculated was 20 L·kg−1. After the bioaccumulation period, the concentrations of SDZ in the water and excreta were 4.5 µg·L−1 and 363.5 ng·g−1, respectively. In the depletion period, the concentrations in the water and excreta were 0.01 µg·L−1 and 5.96 ng·g−1, respectively. These results imply that there was little SDZ bioaccumulation in the fish, but that it was distributed in larger amounts in the water. This is due to the physicochemical properties of the molecule with the low Log P value. Regarding the maximum residue limit, the value was below the established value. This study contributes to understanding SDZ dynamics in an aquatic species native to Brazil. © 2023 by the authors.	Article	Scopus

Plant-fungus interactions can improve this technique. Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms is a macrophyte reported to bioremediate contaminated water. Thus, the present study aimed to isolate endophytic fungi from E. crassipes, select a highly cadmium (Cd) tolerant isolate and evaluate its bioremediation potential. This was evaluated by (1) the fungus tolerance and capacity to accumulate Cd; (2) Cd effects on cell morphology (using SEM and TEM) and on the fungal antioxidant defense system, as well as (3) the effect on model plant Solanum lycopersicum L. cultivar Calabash Rouge, inoculated with the endophyte fungus and exposed to Cd. Our results selected the endophyte Mucor sp. CM3, which was able to tolerate up to 1000 g/L of Cd and to accumulate 900 mg of Cd/g of biomass. Significant changes in Mucor sp. CM3 morphology were observed when exposed to high Cd concentrations, retaining this metal both in its cytoplasm and in its cell wall, which may be linked to detoxification and metal sequestration mechanisms related to the formation of Cd-GSH complexes. In addition, Cd stress induced the activation of all tested antioxidant enzymes – superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR) – in this endophytic fungus. Moreover, when inoculated in tomato plants, this fungus promoted plant growth (in treatments without Cd) and induced an increased metal translocation to plant shoot, showing its potential to increase metal bioremediation. Therefore, this study indicates that the isolated endophyte Mucor sp. CM3 can be applied as a tool in different plant conditions, improving plant bioremediation and reducing the environmental damage caused by Cd, while also promoting plant growth in the absence of contaminants. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Concentrations of Se applied to the soil and leaves were evaluated considering the physiology, total antioxidant activity (TAA), agronomic attributes and Se content in tubers. The spatial distribution of Se was evaluated by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry microanalysis (μ-XRF). Soil application of Se did not significantly affect photosynthetic variables, TAA and yield attributes. However, foliar application caused phytotoxicity in the aerial part, at all doses tested, which reduced yield and caused losses of approximately 172.8 g of tubers per pot. Se content increased in tubers with increasing concentration of sodium selenate, regardless of the application form. μ-XRF analysis showed that Se uptake is not limited to the tuber peel. Potato plants translocated Se from the soil and leaves and accumulated this element inside the tubers. So, when Se is applied into the soil at 0.50 mg dm−3, potato plants accumulate it in the edible portion of tubers. Although foliar application resulted in accumulation of Se inside the tubers, caution is recommended in choosing the dose, due to the sensitivity of potato to this element. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Association for Potato Research.

This study was performed in Puruzinho Lake, a remote body of water in the Brazilian Amazon from which a riparian human population obtains an important part of its animal protein intake. Samples from 92 individuals, comprising 13 species and four trophic guilds (iliophagous, planktivorous, omnivorous, and piscivorous fish) were analysed for the determination of trace elements (Fe, Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn, Ca, Sr, Cd, Sn, Tl and Pb) and methylmercury concentrations. Samples from the same individuals had already been analysed for stable isotope (SI) measurements (δ13C and δ15N) in a previous investigation and the SI data have been statistically treated with those generated in this study for the evaluation of trophic dynamics of contaminants. Methylmercury was the only analyte that biomagnified, presenting TMF values of 4.65 and 4.55 for total and resident ichthyofauna, respectively. Trace elements presented either trophic dilution or independence from the trophic position, constituting a behaviour that was coherent with that found in the scientific literature. The similarity between Ni behaviour through the trophic web to that of essential elements contributes to the discussion on the essentiality of this metal to fish. Considering the Non-cancer Risk Assessment, the calculated Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) values were higher than 1.0 for all analysed individuals for methylmercury, as well as for only one individual for nickel. No other analyte rendered THQ values higher than 1.0. © 2023	Article	Scopus

Here, we suggest that an updated discussion on this issue requires considering three dimensions. The first one is ontological as it refers to the fundamentals that underlie the category of being a mineral plant nutrient, the second one refers to the practical rules helping to assign a given element to that category, while the third dimension implies the consequences of those rules for human activities. We highlight the idea that the definition of what is a mineral plant nutrient can be enriched by incorporating an evolutionary perspective, thus giving biological insight and helping to integrate information from different disciplines. Following this perspective, mineral nutrients can be contemplated as the elements adopted and/or retained, along evolution, for survival and successful reproduction. We suggest that the operational rules stated in both early and recent works, while highly valuable for their original purposes, will not necessarily account for fitness under the conditions prevailing in natural ecosystems where elements were adopted and are retained -as a result of natural selection processes- covering a wide spectrum of biological activities. We outline a new definition that considers the mentioned three dimensions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.	Review	Scopus

One of the main quality parameters is the biodiesel content in diesel blends, which needs to conform to regional legislations. In this work, a microfluidic device exploiting chemical derivatization of alkyl esters and detection by smartphone-based digital-image colorimetry was developed. It was designed to ensure proper experimental conditions for chemical derivatization, including reagent release, and photometric measurements. Analytes reacted with alkaline hydroxylamine yielding the corresponding alkyl hydroxamates, measured as colored Fe(III) complexes. Analytical response was based on the measurement of the G (green) channel from RGB color system. By taking methyl linoleate as a model compound, a linear response was obtained from 0.1% to 0.6%(v/v) (Analytical signal = 69.6 +2.1 C, r = 0.999), coefficient of variation (n = 10) of 4.0% and limit of detection (99.7% confidence) of 0.04%(v/v). Procedure consumes 1.2 µL of sample, 230 µg of hydroxylamine, 480 µg of NaOH, 14 µg of Fe(III) and equivalent to 1.2 µL of 69%(v/v) HNO3. Accurate results were achieved in relation to the MIR reference method, with agreement at the 95% confidence level. © 2023 The Authors	Article	Scopus

Although xylem embolism resistance thresholds (for example, Ψ50) and hydraulic safety margins (for example, HSM50) are important predictors of drought-induced mortality risk3–5, little is known about how these vary across Earth’s largest tropical forest. Here, we present a pan-Amazon, fully standardized hydraulic traits dataset and use it to assess regional variation in drought sensitivity and hydraulic trait ability to predict species distributions and long-term forest biomass accumulation. Parameters Ψ50 and HSM50 vary markedly across the Amazon and are related to average long-term rainfall characteristics. Both Ψ50 and HSM50 influence the biogeographical distribution of Amazon tree species. However, HSM50 was the only significant predictor of observed decadal-scale changes in forest biomass. Old-growth forests with wide HSM50 are gaining more biomass than are low HSM50 forests. We propose that this may be associated with a growth–mortality trade-off whereby trees in forests consisting of fast-growing species take greater hydraulic risks and face greater mortality risk. Moreover, in regions of more pronounced climatic change, we find evidence that forests are losing biomass, suggesting that species in these regions may be operating beyond their hydraulic limits. Continued climate change is likely to further reduce HSM50 in the Amazon6,7, with strong implications for the Amazon carbon sink. © 2023, The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

Despite the vast Colombian marine biodiversity, not all the country's coastlines have received the same attention, like the Pacific coast. In this study, we assessed photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) and photoprotective compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids - MAAs) in seaweeds from the Colombian Pacific coast. We collected seven species of seaweeds, namely Boodleopsis verticillata, Bostrychia calliptera, B. radicans, B. cf. scorpioides; Catenella impudica, Cladophora graminea and Rhizoclonium riparium, easily found in supralittoral and mangrove ecosystems, at low tide, in contrasting periods of high and low UV index over the year of 2021. The sampling area encompassed a latitudinal gradient (3° S to 6° S) along the Colombian Pacific coast, changing the pattern of the chlorophyll-a and total carotenoid content in different species collected in contrasting UV-index periods. MAAs were quantified using standards (shinorine, porphyra-334, and palythine). This study corroborates the hypothesis that tropical species produce higher concentrations of MAAs in response to UV radiation, with significant differences in the high UV-index period. The highest MAA content (5.68 mg.g−1 DW) was reported in Bostrychia calliptera during the high UV-index period. Ceramiales and Cladophorales species represented a photoprotective potential with at least six different MAAs. Shinorine, palythine and porphyra-334 were quantified; and mycosporine-methylamine-serine and aplysiapalythine C were putatively identified by LC-MS/MS dereplication, this, therefore representing a pioneer study on the chemical composition of Colombian Pacific marine macroalgae. © 2023	Article	Scopus

Such environmental alterations could change the primary producers’ composition, exacerbating the proliferation of harmful microorganisms such as cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria can produce several secondary metabolites, including guanitoxin, a potent neurotoxin and the only naturally occurring anticholinesterase organophosphate ever reported in the literature. Therefore, this study investigated the acute toxicity of guanitoxin-producing cyanobacteria Sphaerospermopsis torques-reginae (ITEP-024 strain) aqueous and 50% methanolic extracts in zebrafish (Danio rerio) hepatocytes (ZF-L cell line), zebrafish embryos (fish embryo toxicity - FET) and specimens of the microcrustacean Daphnia similis. For this, hepatocytes were exposed to 1–500 mg/L of the ITEP-024 extracts for 24 h, the embryos to 31.25–500 mg/L for 96 h, and D. similis to 10–3000 mg/L for 48 h. Non-target metabolomics was also performed to analyze secondary metabolites produced by the ITEP-024 using LC-MS/MS. Metabolomics indicated the guanitoxin presence just in the aqueous extract of the ITEP-024 and the presence of the cyanopeptides namalides, spumigins, and anabaenopeptins in the methanolic extract. The aqueous extract decreased the viability of zebrafish hepatocytes (EC(I)50(24h) = 366.46 mg/L), and the methanolic extract was not toxic. FET showed that the aqueous extract (LC50(96) = 353.55 mg/L) was more toxic than the methanolic extract (LC50(96) = 617.91 mg/L). However, the methanolic extract had more sublethal effects, such as abdominal and cardiac (cardiotoxicity) edema and deformation (spinal curvature of the larvae). Both extracts immobilized daphnids at the highest concentration analyzed. However, the aqueous extract was nine times more lethal (EC(I)50(48h) = 108.2 mg/L) than the methanolic extract (EC(I)50(48h) = 980.65 mg/L). Our results showed an imminent biological risk for aquatic fauna living in an ecosystem surrounded by ITEP-024 metabolites. Our findings thus highlight the urgency of understanding the effects of guanitoxin and cyanopeptides in aquatic animals. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

However, belowground dynamics under ICLF have not been investigated deeply, particularly the role of incorporating dead root material, a forefront strategy for releasing nutrients and storing carbon. To better understand belowground interactions, we conducted a 21-month assessment of fine-root growth and decomposition in an ICLF system, starting when Eucalyptus urograndis trees were three years old. Eucalyptus rows were spaced 15 m apart and integrated with annual crops and pasture. Distances of 1.9, 4.3, and 7.5 m from the trees were evaluated under two successional periods: (i) annual crop, when corn was interspaced with palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha); and (ii) pasture, when palisade grass was grazed. We used the minirhizotron technique to track fine-root production and decomposition down to a depth of 70 cm, capturing 2400 images. Root longevity was estimated per root diameter class (0-0.5-, 0.5–1.0-, and 1.0–2.0-mm) and phenotypical groups (e.g., grasses [corn + palisade grass] and Eucalyptus). Our data showed that root decomposition rate and necromass inputs into the soil were reduced at the closest distance from the Eucalyptus rows (i.e., 1.9 m). The incorporation of decomposed roots was higher in the topsoil (0–28 cm) and declined with increasing soil depths. The total decomposed root incorporation was 101 m m−2 of soil image for 7.5 and 4.3 m inter-row positions, almost twice as high as the recorded at 1.9 m (54 m m−2) from the trees. Daily root decomposition rates increased during the last rainy season, benefited from numerous dead corn roots, and facilitated by higher soil moisture and temperature. Grasses and Eucalyptus roots at 7.5 m from the tree rows had shorter longevity than those at 1.9 m, remaining 88 and 152 days less, respectively. Root diameter influenced the decomposition rate as thicker roots (diameter between 1.0 and 2.0 mm) of grasses and Eucalyptus stood in the soil for 243 and 261 days longer than the finest roots (diameter <0.5 mm). Our results highlight that root necromass accretion and decomposition are heterogeneous in ICLF systems. Furthermore, 3-to-5-year-old Eucalyptus trees drive the interactions, creating microclimate conditions that impair corn and palisade grass root production and reduce root turnover close to the trees. These findings provide a scientific base for managing the ICLF system (spatial and temporal arrangements) and developing models of soil carbon addition via roots in such complex and heterogeneous systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The lambari rosa (Astyanax altiparanae) is a microphage fish, which feeds on microscopic beings and particles, making it potentially susceptible to ingesting MPs discarded in the environment. In addition, this fish is of great economic and food importance, as it is used for human consumption. This study aimed to evaluate the accumulation and possible toxicological effects caused to lambari rosa (n = 450) by the ingestion of polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MPs, since the MPs of these polymers in the form of granules, fragments, and fibers are the most commonly reported in the aquatic environment. The parameters investigated here were the quantitative analysis of ingested MPs using microscopic and staining techniques, as well as the mortality rate, malformations/injuries, and impaired weight gain. At the end of the experiment, it was concluded that MPs from both polymers accumulated in the gastrointestinal tract of the lambari rosa, and that dietary exposure, especially to the PET polymer, was responsible for increasing the mortality rate in this species. © 2023 by the authors.

The preparation of ncAAs like enduracididine and capreomycidine currently takes multiple biosynthetic or chemosynthetic steps, thus limiting the commercial availability and applicability of these cyclic guanidine-containing amino acids. We recently discovered and characterized the biosynthetic pathway of guanitoxin, a potent freshwater cyanobacterial neurotoxin, that contains an arginine-derived cyclic guanidine phosphate within its highly polar structure. The ncAA l-enduracididine is an early intermediate in guanitoxin biosynthesis and is produced by GntC, a unique pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme. GntC catalyzes a cyclodehydration from a stereoselectively γ-hydroxylated l-arginine precursor via a reaction that functionally and mechanistically diverges from previously established actinobacterial cyclic arginine ncAA pathways. Herein, we interrogate l-enduracididine biosynthesis from the cyanobacterium Sphaerospermopsis torques-reginae ITEP-024 using spectroscopy, stable isotope labeling techniques, and X-ray crystallography structure-guided site-directed mutagenesis. GntC initially facilitates the reversible deprotonations of the α- and β-positions of its substrate before catalyzing an irreversible diastereoselective dehydration and subsequent intramolecular cyclization. The comparison of holo- and substrate-bound GntC structures and activity assays on site-specific mutants further identified amino acid residues that contribute to the overall catalytic mechanism. These interdisciplinary efforts at structurally and functionally characterizing GntC enable an improved understanding of how nature divergently produces cyclic arginine ncAAs and generate additional tools for their biocatalytic production and downstream biological applications. © 2023 The Authors.

Integrative analysis was performed by combining high-throughput sequencing and environmental data to decipher changes in the waste microbiome. The results revealed that animal-derived compost stabilized more carbon and mineralized a more organic nitrogen than vegetable-derived compost. Composting enhanced bacterial diversity and turned the bacterial community structure similar among all wastes, reducing Firmicutes abundance in animal-derived wastes. Potential biomarkers indicating compost maturation were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota phyla, Chryseolinea genus and Rhizobiales order. The waste source influenced the final physicochemical attributes, whereas composting enhanced the complexity of the microbial community in the order of poultry litter > filter cake > chicken manure. Therefore, composted wastes, mainly the animal-derived ones, seem to present more sustainable attributes for agricultural use, despite their losses of C, N, and S. © 2023	Article	Scopus

Tree size has emerged as a major axis of drought vulnerability. To understand how Amazon tree species are distributed along size-linked gradients of water and light availability, we tested the niche acclimation hypothesis that there is a developmental gradient in ontogenetic shift in embolism resistance and tree water-use efficiency among tree species that occurs along the understory-overstory gradient. We evaluated ontogenetic differences in the intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) and xylem hydraulic traits of abundant species in a seasonal tropical forest in Brazil. We found that saplings of dominant overstory species start with a high degree of embolism resistance to survive in a dense understory environment where competition for water and light among smaller trees can be intense during the prolonged dry season. Vulnerability to embolism consistently changed with ontogeny and varied with tree species' stature (maximum height): mature individuals of larger species displayed increased vulnerability, whereas smaller species displayed unchanging or even increased resistance at the mature stage. The ability to change drought-resistance strategies (vulnerability to embolism) through ontogeny was positively correlated with ontogenetic increase in iWUE. Ecologically, overstory trees appear to shift from being hydraulically drought resilient to persisting under dry soil surface layer conditions to being more likely physiological drought avoiders as adults when their roots reach wetter and deeper soil layers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

Despite being an important agricultural centre, Brazil's semi-arid region is experiencing significant desertification. However, the relationship between land management and climate in this process is still poorly understood. This research was conducted in areas predominantly covered by the Caatinga Formation (62.2%), as well as agropastoral and pasture areas (29.9%). Our primary objective was to assess the land use change trajectories and land occupation patterns in the region while also analysing how vegetation and precipitation temporal patterns have changed from 1985 to 2019. The trends in vegetation and precipitation were evaluated using the Mann-Kendall test. Land use and occupation patterns were analysed using segmented regression and Monte Carlo simulation for future forecasting in the period 2020–240 under different scenarios (pessimistic, conservative, and optimistic). The Mann-Kendall test indicated that the precipitation trends were not statistically significant. However, the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) exhibited a significant trend in areas near the São Francisco River, an important agricultural area. Land use and occupation showed breakpoints from 1990 onwards for most classes. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the Caatinga Formation will likely to remain the predominant vegetation class in the region for the next 21 years in all predicted scenarios. Agropastoral and pasture classes are projected to increase by 8% and 3%, respectively, while the area covered by native vegetation is expected to decrease by 7.5%. Furthermore, the predictions showed a decline in the rivers and lakes class, which may result in significant economic and social problems. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the impacts of land use change in the Brazilian semi-arid region and provide science-based information for environmental public policies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the large scale of production, quality control systems must be utilized to assess insect quality to optimize prerelease activities. However, the parasitism rate, and the unparasitized puparia, which become waste pupae, can only be known after waiting for the emergence of the adults from sampled pupae (ca. 16 days at 25 °C). This waiting time can result in resources being wasted. A way to speed up the quality control of pupal batches and increase the accuracy of the production process would be to combine digital radiography of the parasitized pupae and deep learning methods for the automatic classification of images. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to discriminate parasitized from waste pupae through X-ray images and to test the suitability of 7 Convolutional Neural Networks to classify the pupal images. Radiographic images from 11-day-old pupae allowed the in vivo identification of immature stages of the parasitoid, preserving the viability of the wasp. A positive correlation was found between the number of emerged parasitoids and the ones identified in the X-ray images. In terms of performance metrics, the accuracies achieved by all CNN-based neural architectures were higher than 97%, indicating a high predictive classification power. At least three of the CNNs tested showed great potential as classifiers of X-ray images of parasitized pupae and can be indicated for practical applications in quality control programs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Lactose determination in milk is hindered by the matrix complexity and lack of chromophore groups. Chromatography, volumetric, and spectrophotometric approaches involving chemical derivatization are time-consuming and require laborious sample preparation, which is incompatible with the high analytical demand. In this context, a novel approach is presented for lactose determination in milk exploiting smartphone-based digital-image photometry. It was based on a modification of the Benedict's method, involving formation of the violet Cu(i)/2,2′-biquinoline-4,4′-dicarboxylate (BCA) complex instead of the copper(i) oxide precipitate, aiming at improvement of sensitivity and precision. Sample pretreatment and analyte derivatization were performed in Eppendorf tubes with minimal reagent amounts and a smartphone camera was used for image acquisition under controlled conditions. Measurements were based on the RGB color system, taking channel G as the analytical response because of the complementarity with the color of the complex. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed procedure yielded a linear response up to 20 mg L−1 (r = 0.999), with a limit of detection of 1.5 mg L−1, which is compatible with determination of lactose in milk and dairy products categorized with low content of the sugar. The procedure takes less than 10 min, with a coefficient of variation of 3.0% (n = 12) and consumes as low as 160 μg Cu and 430 μg BCA per determination, thus being a more practical, fast, cost-effective, and environmental friendly analytical method. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Herein, our working hypothesis was that Si stoichiometry favors the efficient use of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in sugarcane plants. Therefore, a field experiment was carried out using a 3 × 3 factorial scheme consisting of three cultivars (RB92579, RB021754 and RB036066) and three forms of Si application (control without Si; sodium silicate spray at 40 mmol L−1 in soil during planting; sodium silicate spray at 40 mmol L−1 on leaves at 75 days after emergence). All Si fertilizations altered the elemental C and P stoichiometry and sugarcane yield, but silicon-induced responses varied depending on sugarcane cultivar and application method. The most prominent impacts were found in the leaf Si-sprayed RB92579 cultivar, with a significant increase of 7.0% (11 Mg ha−1) in stalk yield, 9.0% (12 Mg ha−1) in total recoverable sugar, and 20% (4 Mg ha−1) in sugar yield compared to the Si-without control. In conclusion, our findings clearly show that silicon soil and foliar fertilization alter C:N:P stoichiometry by enhancing the efficiency of carbon and phosphorus utilization, leading to improved sugarcane production and industrial quality. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.

Here, we studied this remarkable phenomenon for Bipolaris sorokiniana in two wheat cultivars differing in resistance to this fungal root pathogen. Results: The results showed that repeated exposure of the susceptible wheat cultivar to the pathogen led to a significant reduction in disease severity after five successive growth cycles. Surprisingly, the resistant wheat cultivar, initially included as a control, showed the opposite pattern with an increase in disease severity after repeated pathogen exposure. Amplicon analyses revealed that the bacterial families Chitinophagaceae, Anaerolineaceae and Nitrosomonadaceae were associated with disease suppressiveness in the susceptible wheat cultivar; disease suppressiveness in the resistant wheat cultivar was also associated with Chitinophagaceae and a higher abundance of Comamonadaceae. Metagenome analysis led to the selection of 604 Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs), out of a total of 2,571 identified by AntiSMASH analysis, that were overrepresented when the soil entered the disease suppressive state. These BGCs are involved in the biosynthesis of terpenes, non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides, aryl polyenes and post-translationally modified peptides. Conclusion: Combining taxonomic and functional profiling we identified key changes in the rhizosphere microbiome during disease suppression. This illustrates how the host plant relies on the rhizosphere microbiome as the first line of defense to fight soil-borne pathogens. Microbial taxa and functions identified here can be used in novel strategies to control soil-borne fungal pathogens. © 2023, The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

Some types of microplastics, such as glitter, remain overlooked. Glitter particles are artificial reflective microplastics used by different consumers within arts and handcraft products. In nature, glitter can physically affect phytoplankton by causing shade or acting as a sunlight-reflective surface, influencing primary production. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of five concentrations of non-biodegradable glitter particles in two bloom-forming cyanobacterial strains, Microcystis aeruginosa CENA508 (unicellular) and Nodularia spumigena CENA596 (filamentous). Cellular growth rate, estimated by optical density (OD), demonstrated that the applied highest glitter dosage decreases cyanobacterial growth rate with a more evident effect on M. aeruginosa CENA508. The cellular biovolume of N. spumigena CENA596 increased following the application of high concentrations of glitter. Still, no significant difference was detected in chlorophyll-a and carotenoids’ contents for both strains. These results suggest that environmental concentrations of glitter, similar to the highest dosage tested (>200 mg glitter L−1), may negatively influence susceptible organisms of the aquatic ecosystems, as observed with M. aeruginosa CENA508 and N. spumigena CENA596. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The increase in the use of these substances is intrinsically linked to their environmental detection. In this regard, the present work aims to evaluate the presence of the antidepressants venlafaxine, citalopram, fluoxetine, and sertraline in the Piracicaba River and to perform acute and chronic toxicity tests in Daphnia magna with the environmental concentration detected. The samples were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) methodology and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source. The highest environmental concentration detected for the acute and chronic tests with the individual antidepressants and their mixtures was used. The parameters used in the acute test were immobility and mortality, while in the chronic test were reproduction, survival, and dorsal and ventral size of D. magna. The acute risk quotient (RQ) was also estimated for each substance. The detection method was precise. The concentrations were determined to range from 1.0 to 4.48 ng L−1. The determined environmental concentrations do not present an acute risk for D. magna. According to the calculated RQ, antidepressants do not pose an acute risk to D. magna. The mixture of antidepressants using ambient concentrations did not cause dead or immobilized organisms. Reproduction and dorsal size of D. magna were affected by individual antidepressants and their mixtures. Antidepressants are present in the freshwater environment and can cause changes in non-target organisms; more studies are needed to verify the real impact of these substances on the entire trophic chain. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Small wetlands could play an important role in both pursuits for having high per-unit-area rates of element cycling and species richness while deeply penetrating crop fields. However, their potential for ecosystem service provisioning is unlikely to be met if land management intensification promotes ecosystem destabilization in biomass production. We tested the consequences of land use intensification on various dimensions of freshwater ecosystem stability by means of a large-scale field experiment converting extensive pastures to intensive pastures and sugarcane plantations in Southeastern Brazil. Nested within experimental plots were 4000 L mesocosms simulating ponds and puddles commonly found in productive landscapes. Mesocosms were monitored for basic physico-chemical parameters, nutrients, pesticides, phytoplankton standing crop, and the spontaneously colonizing biodiversity. Despite severe environmental change, the stability of sugarcane communities was no different from that of extensive and intensive pastures. This occurred because the local extinction of a sensitive top dragonfly predator following the application of vinasse and insecticide was compensated by colonization of a suite of more tolerant invertebrate mesopredators such as beetles and bugs. Community stability tended to increase with biomass asynchrony and species richness, evidencing a portfolio effect of biodiversity. Unfortunately, the species richness necessary to stabilize biomass production is unlikely to be available in many sugarcane fields and several other row crops. Synthesis and applications. Ponds and puddles could be effective centers of irradiation of ecosystem service provisioning in agricultural fields in terms of pest control; nutrient accumulation, cycling and export back to fields; and habitat and stepping stones for freshwater biodiversity. However, the impoverished biodiversity that results from a combination of harsh local conditions and spatial isolation renders pond communities inherently unstable. Given the unlikely, immediate reduction in agrochemical use in much of the intensively managed crop area, a combination of large, protected source wetlands at the margin of fields and small constructed or naturally forming ponds and puddles in plantations could contribute to sustainable intensification. © 2023 The Authors.

Forest-to-pasture conversion has been shown to alter the flux of methane gas (CH4) in Amazonian soils, driving a switch from acting as a sink to a source of atmospheric CH4. This study aimed to better understand this phenomenon by investigating soil microbial metagenomes, focusing on the taxonomic and functional structure of methane-cycling communities. Metagenomic data from forest and pasture soils were combined with measurements of in situ CH4 fluxes and soil edaphic factors and analysed using multivariate statistical approaches. We found a significantly higher abundance and diversity of methanogens in pasture soils. As inferred by co-occurrence networks, these microorganisms seem to be less interconnected within the soil microbiota in pasture soils. Metabolic traits were also different between land uses, with increased hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic pathways of methanogenesis in pasture soils. Land-use change also induced shifts in taxonomic and functional traits of methanotrophs, with bacteria harbouring genes encoding the soluble form of methane monooxygenase enzyme (sMMO) depleted in pasture soils. Redundancy analysis and multimodel inference revealed that the shift in methane-cycling communities was associated with high pH, organic matter, soil porosity and micronutrients in pasture soils. These results comprehensively characterize the effect of forest-to-pasture conversion on the microbial communities driving the methane-cycling microorganisms in the Amazon rainforest, which will contribute to the efforts to preserve this important biome. © 2023 The Authors.

Yet, the ecotoxicological risks, particularly non-lethal effects, associated with other co-produced secondary metabolites remain mostly unknown. Here, we assessed survival, morphological alterations, swimming behaviour and cardiovascular functions of zebrafish (Danio rerio) upon exposure to cyanobacterial extracts of two Brazilian Microcystis strains. We verified that only MIRS-04 produced MCs and identified other co-produced cyanopeptides also for the MC non-producer NPCD-01 by LC-HRMS/MS analysis. Both cyanobacterial extracts, from the MC-producer and non-producer, caused acute toxicity in zebrafish with LC50 values of 0.49 and 0.98 mgdw_biomass/mL, respectively. After exposure to MC-producer extract, additional decreased locomotor activity was observed. The cyanopeptolin (micropeptin K139) contributed 52% of the overall mortality and caused oedemas of the pericardial region. Oedemas of the pericardial area and prevented hatching were also observed upon exposure to the fraction with high abundance of a microginin (Nostoginin BN741) in the extract of the MC non-producer. Our results further add to the yet sparse understanding of lethal and sublethal effects caused by cyanobacterial metabolites other than MCs and the need to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the toxicity. We emphasize the importance of considering mixture toxicity of co-produced metabolites in the ecotoxicological risk assessment of cyanobacterial bloom events, given the importance for predicting adverse outcomes in fish and other organisms. © 2023 The Author(s)	Article	Scopus

This often leads to the homogenization of the microbial community and thus favoring stochastic assembly processes. However, there is still a gap in understanding the effect of conversion from natural grasslands to cultivated pastures on soil microbial ecological processes. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the assembly patterns of microbial communities and evaluate the ecological models for generalists and specialist microbes along a grassland management intensification gradient. Through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we found that the conversion of natural grasslands to cultivated pastures has increased the number of microbial specialists, resulting in stochastic assembly processes due to the decrease in plant diversity. Moreover, the ecological processes governing the assembly of microbial communities were affected by soil and vegetation management. The perennial pasture was more affected by homogenizing selection, owing to the lower plant diversity and uniform plant covering and root development. We have found that the generalists in the grasslands are shaped by niche-based models, while the specialists in natural grasslands are more stochastic in nature. For improved pastures, we have found that lognormal and preemption models are more predominant, suggesting that homogenizing dispersal is more predominant than variable selection. We highlight it is essential to comprehend these assembly models and ecological processes to ensure plant-microbe supporting and provisioning ecosystem services for cattle, and humans while establishing management strategies and conservation policy priorities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

A strain of the filamentous cyanobacterial genus Kamptonema was isolated from a water bloom in the Baltic Sea four decades ago and later shown to produce cylindrospermopsins. However, the exact habitat of this strain remains unclear and cylindrospermopsins have not yet been reported from water blooms in the Baltic Sea. Here, we report the isolation of Kamptonema sp. UHCC 0994 from a benthic microbial mat collected in shallow water on the coast of Helsinki. We obtained draft genome sequences for the Kamptonema spp. PCC 7926 and UHCC 0994 strains that were isolated from the Baltic Sea. These genomes were 90–96% similar to previously studied Kamptonema sp. PCC 6506 and Kamptonema formosum PCC 6407, which were isolated from benthic and North American freshwater environments, respectively. The genomes of all four Kamptonema strains encode complete cylindrospermopsin biosynthetic gene clusters. We detected the production of cylindrospermopsin and 7-epi-cylindrospermopsin in the four Kamptonema strains using high-resolution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The four strains encode genes for producing gas vesicles distributed in two to three different regions of their genomes. Kamptonema spp. UHCC 0994 and PCC 7926 have both retained the ability to regulate their buoyancy when grown in liquid culture. Together this suggests that these toxic cyanobacteria may exhibit a tychoplanktic lifestyle in the Baltic Sea. This study suggests that microbial mats containing cyanobacteria could be a source of environmental toxins in the Baltic Sea. © 2023 The Authors	Article	Scopus

However, although both herbicides present low persistence, their potential impact on the community of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) is unclear. To address this gap, this study assessed the short-term effect of imazethapyr, flumioxazin, and their mixture on the PGPB community. Soil samples from soybean fields were treated with these herbicides and incubated for 60 days. We extracted soil DNA at 0, 15, 30, and 60 days and sequenced the 16S rRNA gene. In general, the herbicides presented temporary and short-term effects on PGPB. The relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium increased, while Sphingomonas decreased on the 30th day with the application of all herbicides. Both herbicides increased the potential function of nitrogen fixation at 15th days and decreased at 30th and 60th days of incubation. The proportions of generalists were similar (∼42%) comparing each herbicide and the control, while the proportion of specialists increased (varying from 24.9% to 27.6%) with the application of herbicides. Imazethapyr, flumioxazin and their mixture did not change the complexity and interactions of the PGPB network. In conclusion, this study showed that, in the short term, the application of imazethapyr, flumioxazin, and their mixture, at the recommended field rates, does not negatively affect the community of plant growth-promoting bacteria. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

In order to circumvent this drawback, liquid-liquid microextraction with acetonitrile is proposed for the separation of flavonols from anthocyanins and further partitioning to the aqueous phase as Al(III) complexes with the working pH adjusted to 3.5 to avoid the interference of phenolic acids. The standard addition method circumvented the matrix effects in photometric measurements by digital-image photometry. A linear response was achieved up to 10 mg L-1 quercetin, with coefficient of variation (n = 10) and limits of detection and quantification estimated at 3.1%, 0.5 and 1.7 mg L-1, respectively. Accurate results were achieved in comparison to the spectrophotometric reference procedure. The proposed procedure is a simple and cost-effective approach, with low reagent and solvent consumption (105 µg of Al(III), 15 mg of NaCl, and 1.2 mL of acetonitrile) and waste generation (1.5 mL) per determination. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Conventional methods for soil color determination have come under scrutiny due to their limited accuracy and reliability. In response to these concerns, we developed an innovative system that leverages 35 years of satellite imagery in conjunction with in-situ soil spectral measurements. This approach enables the creation of a global soil color map with a fine spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m. The system initially identifies bare earth areas worldwide using reflectance bands acquired from Landsat 4 through Landsat 8 between 1985 and 2020. Soil color was quantified using the CIE-XYZ coordinates, utilizing 8005 soil spectral measurements within the visible range (380–780 nm) as ground truth data. We established transfer functions to convert Landsat reflectance bands to standardized XYZ color coordinates. These transfer functions were subsequently applied to images of bare surfaces, covering approximately 38.5% of the Earth's surface. We validated the resulting global soil color map using statistical indices derived from an independent set of ground-truth spectral data, demonstrating a high degree of agreement. By creating the world's first global soil color map, we have set a baseline for future spatial and temporal monitoring of soil conditions, thus enhancing our understanding and management of our planet's vital soil resources. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

However, plant domestication reduces genetic diversity, changes plant physiology, and could have an impact on the associated microbiome assembly. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess the microbial community in the bulk soil and rhizosphere of wild, semi-domesticated, and domesticated genotypes of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), to investigate the effect of plant domestication on microbial community assembly. In general, rhizosphere communities were more diverse than bulk soil, but no differences were found among genotypes. Our results showed that the microbial community’s structure was different from wild and semi-domesticated as compared to domesticated genotypes. The community similarity decreased 57.67% from wild to domesticated genotypes. In general, the most abundant phyla were Actinobacteria (21.9%), Proteobacteria (20.7%), Acidobacteria (14%), and Firmicutes (9.7%). Comparing the different genotypes, the analysis showed that Firmicutes (Bacillus) was abundant in the rhizosphere of the wild genotypes, while Acidobacteria dominated semi-domesticated plants, and Proteobacteria (including rhizobia) was enriched in domesticated P. lunatus rhizosphere. The domestication process also affected the microbial community network, in which the complexity of connections decreased from wild to domesticated genotypes in the rhizosphere. Together, our work showed that the domestication of P. lunatus shaped rhizosphere microbial communities from taxonomic to a functional level, changing the abundance of specific microbial groups and decreasing the complexity of interactions among them. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

In some cases, spontaneous auxotrophic mutant fungi may exhibit improved solubilization and phytohormone production compared to the wild type. In this study, six endophytic strains of Alternaria alternata were molecularly identified and found to have the ability to solubilize phosphate and produce 3-indolacetic acid (IAA) in vitro. The A. alternata G3-92 strain was particularly noteworthy for its high levels of phosphate solubilization (2.2 cm) and IAA production (2.6 μg mL−1). This strain was used to obtain auxotrophic mutants using the Potassium Bromate Resistance System, and the most promising mutants were then protoplasted and fused. Comparison with the wild G3-92 strain showed significant improvement in phosphate solubilization (2.9 cm) for the G3-92arg−2, G3-92pro−2, and G3-92AU−2 mutants. IAA production also showed significant improvement for the G3-92trp−3 and G3-92ala−2 mutants, with production of 3.6 and 3.5 μg mL−1, respectively. The fusion of the G3-92trp−3 and G3-92arg−2 protoplasts resulted in eight new recombinant prototrophic strains with improved phosphate solubilization ranging from 2.4 to 2.7 cm. Seven of these recombinants also showed improved IAA production compared to the parental strains, G3-92trp−3 and G3-92arg−2, and the wild strain G3-92Wild, with IAA production ranging from 12 to 22 μg mL−1. These results indicate that these newly obtained recombinant strains have potential for use as eco-friendly agricultural inoculants, as an alternative to chemical fertilizers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

This study hypothesized that different land-use affect the microbial enzymatic stoichiometry and C-, N-, and P-acquisition in Brazilian semiarid soils. Thus, the enzymes β-glucosidase (C-acquiring enzyme), urease (N-acquiring enzyme), and acid phosphatase (P-acquiring enzyme) were assessed in soil samples collected at 0–5 and 5–10 cm depth from a tropical dry forest, a protected area with Angico, a protected area with Ipê, scrub area, and an agricultural area with maize. The values of C-, N-, and P-acquiring enzymes were used to calculate the enzymatic C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios. The values of C:P and N:P ratios were higher at 0–5 cm depth, while no significant variation, between soil depth, was observed for C:N ratio. The values of C- and N-acquiring enzymes were higher at 0–5 cm in tropical dry forest areas and Angico forest, respectively. In all land use types, the values of vectors L and A were higher than 1° and 45°, respectively. This study showed that both land-use and soil depth influence the enzymatic stoichiometry, showing higher values of C- and N-acquiring enzymes in native and protected forests at soil surface.

Although well known for its toxicity, several aspects of As accumulation and biological transformation by field species are still little explored. In this study, the bioaccumulation and speciation of As in phytoplankton and zooplankton from five soda lakes in the Brazilian Pantanal wetland were studied. Such lakes exhibited contrasting biogeochemical characteristics along an environmental gradient. Additionally, the influence of contrasting climatic events was assessed by collecting samples during an exceptional drought in 2017 and a flood in 2018. Total As (AsTot) content and speciation were determined using spectrometric techniques, while a suspect screening of organoarsenicals in plankton samples was carried out by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Results showed that AsTot content ranged from 16.9 to 62.0 mg kg−1 during the dry period and from 2.4 to 12.3 mg kg−1 during the wet period. The bioconcentration and bioaccumulation factors (BCF and BAF) in phytoplankton and zooplankton were found to be highly dependent on the lake typology, which is influenced by an ongoing evapoconcentration process in the region. Eutrophic and As-enriched lakes exhibited the lowest BCF and BAF values, possibly due to the formation of non-labile As complexes with organic matter or limited uptake of As by plankton caused by high salinity stress. The season played a decisive role in the results, as significantly higher BCF and BAF values were observed during the flooding event when the concentration of dissolved As in water was low. The diversity of As species was found to be dependent on the lake typology and on the resident biological community, cyanobacteria being responsible for a significant portion of As metabolism. Arsenosugars and their degradation products were detected in both phytoplankton and zooplankton, providing evidence for previously reported detoxification pathways. Although no biomagnification pattern was observed, the diet seemed to be an important exposure pathway for zooplankton. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Nanobiocomposites (NBC) produced from endophytic fungi (potentially remediation dyes-agents) and magnetic nanoparticles have high biotechnological potential due to their superparamagnetic behavior, which would allow their recovery through the magnetic field after the bioremediation process. This work aimed to obtain a new nanobiocomposite from the interaction of magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) with the endophyte Aspergillus flavus (Af-CL-7) to evaluate its bioremediation capacity and to reduce the toxicity of RB5 and its reuse. Before obtaining the NBC, Af-CL-7 showed discoloration of RB5 and it was tolerant to all tested concentrations of this dye. The discovery of the nanobiocomposite textile dye bioremediator product presents a significant environmental advantage by addressing the issue of water pollution caused by textile dyes. The NBC called Af-Fe3O4 was successfully obtained with the magnetized endophyte, and their magnetic properties were verified by VSM analysis and by action of magnetic fields generated by Nd-Fe-B magnets SEM analyzes showed that the nanoparticles did not cause any damage to the hypha morphology, and TEM analyzes confirmed the presence of nanoparticles in the fungus wall and also inside the cell. The NBC Af-Fe3O4 and Af-CL-7 showed, respectively, 96.1% and 92.2% of RB5 discoloration in the first use, 91.1% e 86.2% of discoloration in the validation test, and 89.0% in NBC reuse. In the toxicological bioassay with Lactuca sativa seeds, NBC showed a positive reduction in the toxicity of RB5 after treatment, allowing the hypocotyl growth to be statistically similar to the control with water. Thus, we highlight the promising obtaining process of NBC that could be applied in bioremediation of contaminated waters, wherein the industrial economic cost will depend on the fermentation efficiency, biomass production and nanoparticle synthesis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

However, the extent to which these changes affect such services is still poorly understood in tropical agroecosystems. Our main goal was to evaluate how land-use (tilled versus no-tilled soil), soil management (N-fertilization), and microbial diversity depletion [tenfold (D1 = 10−1) and thousandfold (D3 = 10−3) dilutions] impacted soil enzyme activities (β-glycosidase and acid phosphatase) involved in nutrient cycles and glyphosate mineralization. Soils were collected from a long-term experimental area (35 years) and compared to its native forest soil (NF). Glyphosate was selected due to its intensive use in agriculture worldwide and in the study area, as well as its recalcitrance in the environment by forming inner sphere complexes. Bacterial communities played a more important role than the fungi in glyphosate degradation. For this function, the role of microbial diversity was more critical than land use and soil management. Our study also revealed that conservation tillage systems, such as no-tillage, regardless of nitrogen fertilizer use, mitigates the negative effects of microbial diversity depletion, being more efficient and resilient regarding glyphosate degradation than conventional tillage systems. No-tilled soils also presented much higher β-glycosidase and acid phosphatase activities as well as higher bacterial diversity indexes than those under conventional tillage. Consequently, conservation tillage is a key component for sustaining soil health and its functionality, providing critical ecosystem functions, such as soil detoxification in tropical agroecosystems. © 2023	Article	Scopus

However, little is known about arsenic speciation in this environment, particularly regarding speciation changes related to lake trophic status and seasonal variations. To fill this gap, arsenic speciation analysis was carried out in surface (SW) and subsurface (SSW) waters sampled in five soda lakes with different eutrophication status, in two dry and one wet season. As(V) was the dominant species in these waters, while As(III), DMA, MMA and likely complex organic species were present in lower amounts. The results allow to conclude that the arsenic speciation in SW and SSW varies seasonally according to the regional wet or dry periods and lake water levels. In eutrophic turbid and in oligotrophic vegetated soda lakes, arsenic speciation was also characterized by spatial differences between edge and center or between the SW and SSW. Cyanobacteria or macrophytes/algae are involved in arsenic biotransformation in soda lakes through its metabolic and detoxification processes. Significant variation in surface water arsenic speciation occurs as a result of seasonal primary production fluctuation or water arsenic concentration changes in the soda lakes, increasing organoarsenics in dry periods, whereas in flood periods, As(V) prevails. Spatial distribution of arsenic species is significantly impacted by biogeochemical conditions at the water/sediment interface in soda lakes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Here we studied a 20-year chronosequence of three Technosols constructed with dolomitic limestone mining waste: two cultivated with sugarcane (for 3 and 7 years) and one under pasture (for ∼20 years). Through a combination of SOM physical fractionation and wet-chemical extractions, we aimed to unravel the processes driving SOM accumulation in these soils and developed a conceptual model for embryonic soils developed from Ca, Mg and pyrite-rich parent material. Our results revealed that the weathering of comminuted waste rocks (e.g., shale, siltstone) provided 2:1 minerals (especially smectite) to participate in mineral-organic associations. The weathering of primary minerals also promoted the formation of secondary minerals, which interacted with SOM and increased the amount of mineral associated organic matter (MAOM) up to 20 g SOC kg−1. Pyrite oxidation produced highly reactive secondary Fe phases, while the dolomite dissolution increased the concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and maintained near-neutral pH conditions, favoring the formation of cation-bridges. The progressive increase in the different operational Fe fractions (Fe in organomineral complex, poorly crystalline, and crystalline Fe oxides) along the Technosol chronosequence was strongly correlated with MAOM, highlighting the significant role of Fe in SOM accumulation. Furthermore, we observed substantial increase in particulate organic matter (POM), up to 22 g SOC kg−1, which was associated with increased aggregate formation and stability. These processes collectively contribute to the protection of SOM during early stages of soil development from in Ca, Mg, and pyrite-rich parent material, and thus indicate a high potential for carbon sequestration. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Cyanobacteria survive this harsh environment having evolved adaptive metabolic plasticity to become the dominant primary producers. The type strain cyanobacterium Halotia branconii CENA392 was isolated from an Antarctic intertidal seashore. The complete circular genome of this strain is presented herein, which was assembled using long-sequence reads. The genome encoded some stress-related genes associated with low-temperature adaptation and biosynthesis of mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) photoprotective compounds. Empirical experimentation demonstrated constitutive production of the MAA porphyra-334 and total carotenoids without exposure to low temperatures or ultraviolet radiation stress. Phylogenetic analysis provided insights on taxonomic placement and evolutionary history of some annotated genes. These data exemplify the importance of generating complete quality genome sequences of microorganisms isolated from extreme intertidal environments, facilitating in-depth evaluation of ecological and taxonomic inferences. © 2023 The Authors.

Before their commercialization and use, careful evaluation of nanopesticides (environmental fate, toxicity, efficacy, modes of action, and agroecosystem interactions) is required. To ensure the environmental safety of nanopesticides, the standardization of protocols in the evaluation of nanoformulation regulatory aspects is needed. In this sense, we consider that radiometric techniques may be applied in the same way as conventional pesticide regulatory tests. This method can be used to track active ingredients in a biological and environmental system, together with other techniques for characterizing nanomaterials. In this review (1) we share our point of view about the use of radiolabeled pesticides to track nanoformulations in biological and environmental scenarios; and (2) we offer a critical discussion about the advantages and challenges of using radiometric techniques to track these active ingredients associated with nanoformulations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Due to its potential threat to food security, increasing attention is being focused on the influence of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration on plant growth and metabolism. In this context, elucidating the mechanisms that govern the interaction between elevated CO2 and hormones is crucial to understanding how crop yield could be affected. In this chapter, we discuss current knowledge about plant growth modulation by hormones in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.

As a result of ongoing studies on Hohenbergia in Bahia, Brazil, here we describe and illustrate Hohenbergia erecta, endemic to the municipality of Mucugê, at Chapada Diamantina. Hohenbergia erecta differs from its morphologically related, H. catingae, by an elongated tubular rosette (vs short stem with a crateriform rosette), and a once-branched cylindrical inflorescence (vs 2–3-branched pyramidal inflorescence), with branches congested at the apex (vs branches laxly arranged). Due to a small distribution area in the Caatinga forest and based on a spatial analysis we categorized it as Endangered (EN), following the IUCN criteria. Hohenbergia erecta is endemic to the central region of Chapada Diamantina, dominant in the area, where no other known Hohenbergia species have been found sympatrically. It is important, however, that new field expeditions are conducted in the region to observe the richness of the genus at Chapada Diamantina. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

The experiment was developed under field conditions Jau city, São Paulo state, Brazil. The treatments were four nitrogen doses – namely 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg ha-1 N – in urea form, in addition to a control treatment (without N), with completely randomized block and four repetitions. The N doses were applied gradually by subsurface drip irrigation spread throughout the sugarcane crop cycle. Biometrics and physiologic parameters and biomass accumulation were evaluated at five sampling times. Linear and quadratic responses of these parameters were verified as a function of N application. Elevating the N dose from 100 to 200 kg ha-1 increased the biomass and the N accumulation of sugarcane above ground by 20 Mg ha-1 and 95 kg ha-1, respectively. The nitrogen fertilization applied by subsurface drip irrigation increased the biomass and N accumulation of aboveground sugarcane, as well as the production rate of all parameters. The gap between maximum biomass accumulation rate (BAR) and nitrogen accumulation rate (NAR) was smooth due drip irrigation management. The irrigation management combined with better plant nutrition show highest results to biomass production. © (2023), (Southern Cross Publishing). All Rights Reserved.	Article	Scopus

The proposed system combines the simplicity of a 24-slot resistively heated aluminum block with the key advantages inherent to closed vessels. Fundamental studies on temperature and pressure were also performed and the difference between the liquid phase temperature (190 °C) and the aluminum block temperature (240 °C) was assigned to the dynamic condensation of the gaseous phase during digestion. The optimized digestion procedure was achieved for 250 mg test portions, 2.0 mL of HNO3 (65% v v−1), 1.5 mL of H2O2 (30% v v−1), and a temperature of 240 °C, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and dwell time of 20 min. Under these conditions, the residual carbon contents in digests were generally below 700 mg L−1. The performance of the CHDS was checked by analyzing plant certified reference materials and the determined concentrations of B, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P, S, and Zn presented no significant differences when compared to the certified values at the 95% confidence level. Recoveries in the 75-108% range and relative standard deviations ≤3% (n = 3) were typically obtained. Also, the system was applied to the analysis of sixteen samples from an interlaboratory trial, and a comparison with alternative single reaction chamber microwave-assisted digestion (SRC MWAD) and open vessel nitro-perchloric decomposition (NP) digestion methods also showed equivalence at a 95% confidence level in most cases. The CHDS system based on thermally convective heating allowed digestion of up to 24 different plant materials in ca. 50 min, but it is not limited to samples and analytes chosen in this work: the CHDS is designed for typical use in elemental inorganic analysis techniques that require liquid-based sample introduction. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The use of synthetic insecticides and selective pressure make many of these pests increasingly resistant to control. Concern for health and the environment requires the development of less toxic and persistent products for the management of these undesirable organisms. The insecticide activity of aqueous extracts of 15 vegetal species was evaluated to control grain beetles, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky in maize stored. The adult insects came from the laboratory at Biological Institute of São Paulo. They were fed with sterilized grains of maize and kept in a room at 25±2°C and 70±% of relative humidity. The plants for the aqueous extracts were crushed in distilled water and the vegetal mass was filtered next. The liquid resulting from the filtering process was stored in plastic containers and frozen for later use. Two tests were conducted: impregnation of filter paper and treatment of grains. Ten insects were evaluated in each batch. Only the aqueous extract of Dahlia pinnata Cavanilles was satisfactory in controlling S. zeamais showing an efficiency of 10.00% in the contact test and an efficiency of 56% in the treated corn kernels. © 2023 Gazi Entomological Research Society.

Microorganisms make a tradeoff between optimizing nutrient uptake, improving biomass yield, and overcoming environmental changes according to environmental hostility. Soda lakes are natural environments rich in carbonate and bicarbonate water, resulting in elevated pH and salinities that frequently approach saturation. We hypothesized that during the dry period (elevated pH and salinity), microorganisms try to overcome this harshness by allocating energy to the cellular maintenance process. As these environmental conditions improve during the wet period, microorganisms will begin to invest in nutrient uptake. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated four soda lakes in two different seasons by applying metagenomics combined with flow cytometry (estimate heterotrophic bacterial biomass). The natural occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in some lakes is the main driver of carbon. These primary producers provide organic carbon that supports heterotrophic bacterial growth and, consequently, a high biomass yield. Under harsh conditions (dry season), cyanobacteria invest in nutrient uptake mechanisms, whereas heterotrophic bacteria allocate energy to survive at the expense of biomass yield. Lakes without cyanobacteria blooms invest in nutrient uptake independent of environmental hostility. This study clarifies the microbial tradeoffs in hostile environments and the impact of this choice on carbon and energy flux in tropical alkaline lakes. © 2022, The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

However, as already available for dairy and beef cattle, empirical models are needed to predict CH4 emissions from sheep for accounting purposes. The objectives of this study were to: 1) collate an intercontinental database of enteric CH4 emissions from individual sheep; 2) identify the key variables for predicting enteric sheep CH4 absolute production (g/d per animal) and yield [g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)] and their respective relationships; and 3) develop and cross-validate global equations as well as the potential need for age-, diet-, or climatic region-specific equations. The refined intercontinental database included 2,135 individual animal data from 13 countries. Linear CH4 prediction models were developed by incrementally adding variables. A universal CH4 production equation using only DMI led to a root mean square prediction error (RMSPE, % of observed mean) of 25.4% and an RMSPE-standard deviation ratio (RSR) of 0.69. Universal equations that, in addition to DMI, also included body weight (DMI + BW), and organic matter digestibility (DMI + OMD + BW) improved the prediction performance further (RSR, 0.62 and 0.60), whereas diet composition variables had negligible effects. These universal equations had lower prediction error than the extant IPCC 2019 equations. Developing age-specific models for adult sheep (>1-year-old) including DMI alone (RSR = 0.66) or in combination with rumen propionate molar proportion (for research of more refined purposes) substantially improved prediction performance (RSR = 0.57) on a smaller dataset. On the contrary, for young sheep (<1-year-old), the universal models could be applied, instead of age-specific models, if DMI and BW were included. Universal models showed similar prediction performances to the diet- and region-specific models. However, optimal prediction equations led to different regression coefficients (i.e. intercepts and slopes) for universal, age-specific, diet-specific, and region-specific models with predictive implications. Equations for CH4 yield led to low prediction performances, with DMI being negatively and BW and OMD positively correlated with CH4 yield. In conclusion, predicting sheep CH4 production requires information on DMI and prediction accuracy will improve national and global inventories if separate equations for young and adult sheep are used with the additional variables BW, OMD and rumen propionate proportion. Appropriate universal equations can be used to predict CH4 production from sheep across different diets and climatic conditions. © 2022 The Authors	Article	Scopus

This work identified inland and seaward mangrove migrations along the Ceará-Mirim estuary (Rio Grande do Norte, northeastern Brazil) during the mid–late Holocene and Anthropocene based on sedimentary features, palynological, and geochemical (δ13C, δ15N, C/N) data integrated with spatial-temporal analysis based on satellite images. The data indicated three phases for the mangrove development: (1°) mangrove expansion on tidal flats with estuarine organic matter between >4420 and ~2870 cal yrs BP, under the influence of the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand; (2°) mangrove contraction with an increased contribution of C3 terrestrial plants between ~2870 and ~84 cal yrs BP due to an RSL fall, and (3°) mangrove expansion onto the highest tidal flats since ~84 cal yr BP due to a relative sea-level rise. However, significant mangrove areas were converted to fish farming before 1984 CE. Spatial-temporal analysis also indicated a mangrove expansion since 1984 CE due to mangrove recolonization of shrimp farming areas previously deforested for pisciculture. This work mainly evidenced a trend of mangrove expansion due to RSL rise preceding the effects of anthropogenic emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere and the resilience of these forests in the face of anthropogenic interventions. © 2023 by the authors.

It unveils that both macro and micronutrients were heterogeneously distributed across seed tissues. Most of the P and S, Fe, Zn, and Mn were mainly found at the embryo axis tissues in all three Fabaceae species, whereas K was spread along the cotyledon and Ca was mostly observed trapped at the seed coat region. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation coefficient revealed a strong spatial correlation between P and S, and K and S in cowpea and soybean seed tissues, whereas Zn and Mn association was also recorded. Therefore, the μ-XRF technique is an important tool for assessing seed nutrient distribution, thus subsidizing the physiological role of nutrients in seeds and fostering innovative approaches for nutrient supply and biofortification. copy; 2022 American Chemical Society. © The Author(s) 2022.

Results obtained for most analytes by the closed-vessel conductively heated digestion system (CHDS) were in agreement with certified values and those attained by the comparative digestion method. The use of 7 mol L−1 HNO3 furnished lower blanks for most analytes and was effective to prepare challenging samples as biomass, biochar, shell and bone meal, swine manure, plants, soil, phosphate rock, and may be a good alternative for elemental determinations using most analytical techniques that rely on solution-based sample introduction systems. The detection limits (dry basis, mg kg−1) for Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, and Zn were 3, 0.4, 4, 4, 0.7, 0.4, 3, and 2, respectively. The mean relative standard deviations were close to 4.9% for closed-vessel conductively heated digestion (CHDS) and 5.9% for microwave-assisted digestion (MW-AD). © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Nevertheless, transcriptomic analyses remain scarce for field-grown plants. Here we performed comparative transcriptional profiling of two contrasting sugarcane genotypes, ‘IACSP97-7065’ (drought-sensitive) and ‘IACSP94-2094’ (drought-tolerant) grown in a drought-prone environment. Physiological parameters and expression profiles were analyzed at 42 (May) and 117 (August) days after the last rainfall. The first sampling was done under mild drought (soil water potential of −60 kPa), while the second one was under severe drought (soil water potential of −75 kPa). Microarray analysis revealed a total of 622 differentially expressed genes in both sugarcane genotypes under mild and severe drought stress, uncovering about 250 exclusive transcripts to ‘IACSP94-2094’ involved in oxidoreductase activity, transcriptional regulation, metabolism of amino acids, and translation. Interestingly, the enhanced antioxidant system of ‘IACSP94-2094’ may protect photosystem II from oxidative damage, which partially ensures stable photochemical activity even after 117 days of water shortage. Moreover, the tolerant genotype shows a more extensive set of responsive transcription factors, promoting the fine-tuning of drought-related molecular pathways. These results help elucidate the intrinsic molecular mechanisms of a drought-tolerant sugarcane genotype to cope with ever-changing environments, including prolonged water deficit, and may be useful for plant breeding programs. © 2022, The Author(s).

Total available water (TAW) is defined as the difference between the water content at field capacity (FC) and at wilting point (WP). The readily available water (RAW) is a fraction of TAW defined as the water content between FC and the limiting point (LP). The challenge in determining TAW and RAW lies in the correct determination of FC, WP, and LP. We propose a process-based approach to address the issue, referenced as flux-based method (FBM). Five scenarios were used to assess the FBM: (1) generic soil-plant-atmosphere conditions, from which sensitivity analyses were performed; (2) a maize crop on several soils to compare the predictions of the FBM and the traditional FAO method; (3) mean plant-atmosphere conditions to map PAW from soil texture using the FBM and the FAO method; (4) a field experiment with a fully irrigated soybean crop; and (5) a field experiment with a common bean crop under water deficit. Resulting flux-based TAW and RAW showed high sensitivity to root length density and soil hydraulic parameters. The FBM tended to predict higher water contents at FC than the FAO method for maize crop scenarios. Texture triangles to predict TAW and RAW showed that the differences between the predictions of FBM and FAO are mostly due to the distinct values for FC, and for the LP, respectively. For both observed scenarios of soybean and common bean crops, the predictions of the FBM were plausible with time series of observed data. The FBM allows predicting PAW in Van Genuchten – Mualem type soils for different FC flux criteria, soil depths, root densities, and dynamic potential transpiration rates. © 2022 The Author(s)	Article	Scopus

The extraction of non-volatile compounds from high-quality and traditional coffee by different methods was evaluated to determine the chemical compounds that discriminate between coffee types. Standard methods of preparing the coffee drink by consumers were evaluated. Method A corresponded to boiling water with coffee, and method B to the strained coffee method. Extraction with different solvents did not distinguish the compounds chosen as markers for coffees. In addition to being non-toxic and low-cost, water was the most suitable solvent, conforming to the principles of green chemistry while enabling direct comparison with sensory analysis. The total dissolved solids, percentage extraction, and non-volatile compounds were quantified to select the most satisfactory extraction method. The TDS value ranged from 1.7 to 3 between methods and coffee types, and the extraction percentage ranged from 25 to 45%. Significant differences in the extracts obtained using methods A and B high-quality versus traditional coffees were detected using the Student’s t-test. Although method A extracted the chemical compounds in more substantial amounts, method B was also efficient in extracting the compounds and was easily executed given its similarity to the usual way of preparing coffee beverages used by consumers. The evaluated non-volatile compounds were identified in both high-quality and traditional coffee samples. In the chosen extraction method (method B), the average concentrations in mg 100 g-1 of the sample found for the compounds were: 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (11±0.5), 3,4-hydroxybenzoic acid (62±4), catechin (58±5), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (58±2), caffeine (1152±44), chlorogenic acid (598±23), caffeic acid (0.7±0.1), and gallic acid (3±0.2). © 2023, Visao Fokka Communication Agency.

Practices affect the diversity and metabolic activities of spontaneous yeasts in fermentations. The control of the initial inoculum is important to standardize fermentations and to improve the final seed quality. We conducted fermentations using non-cleaned or cleaned fermentation boxes to evaluate the dynamics of the microorganism populations and their effect in seed composition in two consecutive years. The isolated yeasts were identified by sequencing the D1-domain of the 26S ribosomal genes. Pulp and cotyledon parameters were monitored during fermentations. Wickerhamomyces anomalus was the dominant yeast in the fermentations, but the species was less represented in cleaned boxes. In the cleaned-box fermentation, there was a delay in temperature rise of the fermentation, which retarded the suitable moment for seed-mass turning. The reduction in seed-pulp quality caused by restricted rainfall in one year limited the seed-mass heating and voided the seed turning. Thus, under substrate restriction, the initial reduced inoculum caused by cleaning the boxes impaired fermentation, mainly under environmental conditions that compromise the quality of the pulp. However, this variation had little effect on the desired degradation of cotyledon components, substrates for flavor precursors. © 2023, Sociedade Brasileira de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Alimentos, SBCTA.

Its unique morphology comprises more than 10,000 lakes with saline-alkaline water and fresh water that coexist in an area of approximately 12,000 km2. This region is subject to seasonal flooding that acts on runoff; however, little is known about its flooding dynamics. Recent advances in the area of geoprocessing have helped expand our knowledge about lacustrine environments. This work evaluates the performance of two supervised classifiers based on machine learning (Support Vector Machine and Random Forest), for characterizing the hydrological dynamics of the Nhecolândia region. The classifiers were applied to nanosatellite images (PlanetScope) using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform.

Lime recommendation for eucalyptus aims to supply the Ca and Mg. Lime might reduce metallic micronutrients content in plants (e.g., Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn), thereby impairing the nutritional status. Copper and zinc fertilization in eucalyptus plantation is recommended to replace the amount extracted from harvesting plant products. We investigated lime and Cu plus Zn application on (a) biomass production, leaf area, and leaf pigments; and (b) Cu and Zn concentration, accumulation, and distribution in Eucalyptus grandis seedlings. The experiment was conducted with eucalyptus seedlings under Ferralsol in five randomized blocks, in a 3 × 4 factorial scheme, with three lime and four fertilizer rates of Cu and Zn. Plants grown under lime application had increased leaf area and flavonoid content. Lime and Cu plus Zn application improved dry biomass relative to plants grown unlimed and micronutrient supply. Copper plus zinc fertilization improves the nutritional status of eucalyptus, leading to enhance content of Cu, Zn, and chlorophyll, which could prove to be a crucial strategy for increased plant growth and, consequently, boosting biomass production. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

Sponge spicules (megascleres, microscleres, and gemmuloscleres) are characterized by widely varying sizes and shapes. These spicules are well-preserved in lacustrine, wetland, and riverine sediments and hold significant ecological and limnological information that can be applied as diagnostic tools in reconstructions of Quaternary environments. However, problems with taxonomy and the absence of systematic guidelines and standards of identification represent major challenges to utilizing freshwater sponges as a paleo-proxy. Here, we present a well-illustrated extraction protocol and morphological guide to the Neotropical freshwater sponge fauna. This guide is intended to introduce researchers and students to the study of freshwater sponges and their use as a diagnostic tool in paleoecology and paleolimnology.

Studies in this region have pointed to climate variations throughout the Holocene, indicating a drier period than the current one in the Pleistocene/Holocene and Middle and Upper Holocene transitions. Although these studies indicate that the denudation rates provide an estimate of the beginning period of the formation of these features, the environmental conditions of climate and vegetation that allowed the development of such processes are still poorly known. Based on the conception of soil as a reservoir of environmental records, and adopting a multiproxy approach, the present study aims to reconstruct the Holocene paleoenvironmental conditions that favored the development of a paleogully in the municipality of Loanda, northwest Paraná. According to the results, the development of this feature is related to an environment with more open vegetation than today, slightly drier and with milder temperature, during the Middle to Late Holocene transition. The increase of humidity in the upper Holocene favored, at first, the enlargement of erosion and, later, already with kilometric dimensions, its stabilization with the advance of the forest. © 2023 Uniao Brasileira de Geomorfologia.

Here, we comprehensively analyzed sequences from enzymes of trehalose metabolism in sugarcane, one of the main crops used for bioenergy production. We identified protein domains, phylogeny, and in silico expression levels for all classes of enzymes. However, post-translational modifications and residues involved in catalysis and substrate binding were analyzed only in trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) sequences. We retrieved 71 putative full-length TPS, 93 trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP), and 3 trehalase (TRE) of sugarcane, showing all their conserved domains, respectively. Putative TPS (Classes I and II) and TPP sugarcane sequences were categorized into well-known groups reported in the literature. We measured the expression levels of the sequences from one sugarcane leaf transcriptomic dataset. Furthermore, TPS Class I has specific N-glycosylation sites inserted in conserved motifs and carries catalytic and binding residues in its TPS domain. Some of these residues are mutated in TPS Class II members, which implies loss of enzyme activity. Our approach retrieved many homo(eo)logous sequences for genes involved in trehalose metabolism, paving the way to discover the role of T6P signaling in sugarcane. © 2022, The Author(s).

Nanoherbicide research has focused on efficiency gains through targeted delivery and environmental risk reduction. However, research on the behavior and safety of the application of these formulations in cropping systems is still limited. Organic matter contained in cropping systems can change the dynamics of herbicide–soil interactions in the presence of nanoformulations. The aim of this study was to use classical protocols from regulatory studies to understand the retention and mobility dynamics of a metribuzin nanoformulation, compared to a conventional formulation. We used different soil systems and soil with added fresh organic material. The batch method was used for sorption–desorption studies and soil thin layer chromatography for mobility studies, both by radiometric techniques. Sorption parameters for both formulations showed that retention is a reversible process in all soil systems (H~1.0). In deep soil with added fresh organic material, nanoformulation was more sorbed (14.61 ± 1.41%) than commercial formulation (9.72 ± 1.81%) (p < 0.05). However, even with the presence of straw as a physical barrier, metribuzin in nano and conventional formulations was mobile in the soil, indicating that the straw can act as a barrier to reduce herbicide mobility but is not impeditive to herbicide availability in the soil. Our results suggest that environmental safety depends on organic material maintenance in the soil system. The availability can be essential for weed control, associated with nanoformulation efficiency, in relation to the conventional formulation. © 2022 by the authors.	Article	Scopus

To quantify the evolution of the stock and the lability of this carbon pool in the hypothesis of the onset of drier climates, we studied a soil toposequence at the end of which the incision of a river meander lowered the water table, as would result from a drier climate, allowing oxidation the Bh horizons. The soil OM was quantified and characterized (physical fractionation, humification indexes, 14C average age) and its lability under oxic conditions was estimated by measuring respiration during a 660-days experiment. Podzol genesis time was calculated by constraining the carbon fluxes using both C stock and 14C average age. The results confirmed that the studied podzols store large amounts of carbon (62.8 kgC m−2 on average). They resulted from a long genesis time, probably greater than 30–50 ky. Topsoil OM is very labile with a residence time of about 100 y; Bh OM is highly humified with a high C/N (62.7 on average) related to low respiration rates. The measured respiration rates were used to estimate the C emission that would result from drier climates at 55 gC m−2 y−1 on average during the first 100 y, which would correspond, by extrapolation, to 8.5 1012 gC y−1 for all Amazonian podzols. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, we lack studies and/or information about the impacts of land-use change on the biodiversity of soil microorganisms, especially those involved in the phosphorus (P) transformation processes. This represents a great concern since some microbial groups are extremely important to different P transformation processes and regulate P availability in tropical and subtropical regions. In our study, we used shotgun DNA-metagenomic sequencing and P fractionation analysis to assess the effects of forest-to-pasture conversion on the dynamics of soil bacterial groups involved in the P transformation processes and their potential functions. Additionally, we assessed if the dynamics of these specific soil bacterial groups were recovered after pasture abandonment and with secondary forest establishment. Our results demonstrated that the land-use change altered the total amount of P and its fractions in the soils. The bacterial community structure was affected by changes in soil chemical properties, mainly by changes in the aluminum, total P, and labile P contents. The bacterial groups involved in the P transformation processes and their potential functions were also affected by changes in land use. The pasture soil harbored a distinct bacterial community when compared to the primary and secondary forest sites. In general, forest-to-pasture conversion increased bacterial groups involved in the P mineralization, including Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes. Conversely, we observed an increase of Proteobacteria members (e.g., Bradyrhizobiaceae and Beijerinckiaceae) and genes related to P solubilization and mineralization after pasture abandonment and with the secondary forest re-establishment. Our multi-analytical approach suggests that forest-to-pasture conversion has negative impacts on the biodiversity of bacterial groups involved in the P transformation processes and their potential functions, while the secondary forest re-establishment can stimulate resilience. Taken together, our results indicated that the bacterial groups involved in the P transformation and their potential functions can be gradually recovered and reach intermediate and/or even similar levels to those observed in undisturbed forest sites. This brings new insights and helps to improve our knowledge about the impacts of anthropogenic actions on the soil microbiome in the Amazon region. © 2022	Article	Scopus

Anthelmintic resistance can be assessed by the expression of resistance-related genes. Among them, P-glycoproteins (Pgp) have been extensively associated with anthelmintic resistance due to their role in drug efflux. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate gene expression levels of nine Pgp (Pgp-1, Pgp-2, Pgp-3, Pgp-4, Pgp-9, Pgp-10, Pgp-11, Pgp-12, and Pgp-16) in eggs, first-stage larvae (L1), third-stage infective larvae (L3), adult female, and adult male of H. contortus from two isolates characterized as anthelmintic-resistant (R) and -susceptible (S). Four worm-free sheep were experimentally infected with approximately 4000 L3 larvae of H. contortus: two animals received L3 from the R isolate and two animals received L3 from the S isolate. Pgp-9 gene expression in all developmental stages of H. contortus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in R isolate compared to S isolate. Higher expression (P < 0.05) of Pgp genes, except Pgp-4, was observed in L1 stage larvae from the R isolate. Our findings suggest that the L1 stage can be potentially used for anthelmintic resistance characterization through monitoring of different P-glycoproteins gene expression. These results may be useful in subsequent research to unveil anthelmintic resistance mechanisms in H. contortus without slaughtering sheep hosts, because L1 stages can be directly produced from eggs collected from feces. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, the herbicide presence in the soil and plant matrices are not generally quantified. Objective: This study aimed to select plant species to evaluate the phytoremediation of 14 C-tebuthiuron by showy rattlepod (Crotalaria spectabilis), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), radish (Raphanus sativus), peanut (Arachis hypogaea), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) in herbicide-contaminated soil. Methods: The selection of the five herbicide phytoremediation plants was with the application of five rates of tebuthiuron (300, 600, 1,200, 2,400, and 4,800 g a.i. ha-1) and compared to a control. Peanuts and sorghum (herbicide-tolerant plants) were sown in soil contaminated with tebuthiuron (600 g a.i. ha-1) applied through a working solution containing 17.47 kBq of14C-tebuthiuron. The total of herbicide was analyzed in the soil and plant at three phenological stages. Results: Showy rattlepod, radish, and alfalfa were sensitive to the herbicide even at the lowest application rate. Sorghum was tolerant to the herbicide up to 600 g ha-1 with the application of 1,200 g ha-1, there was 80% injury; peanut was tolerant even at the highest rate (4,800 g ha-1) with only 40% injury. Peanut and sorghum were able to phytoremediate the soil, although, peanut was more efficient in decreasing tebuthiuron contamination by 76%, while sorghum reduced at by 45% at 3rd phenological stage. Conclusions: Thus, both plants can be recommended in succession/ rotation with crops that had tebuthiuron applied from pre-emergence weed control. © 2022, The authors.	Article	Scopus

Resistance inducers such as potassium phosphite (KPhi) represent an environmentally friendly alternative for control. The effect of KPhi on disease severity and on the activity of antioxidant enzymes was investigated in wild-type (WT) Micro-Tom plants and mutant/transgenic genotypes were used to determine the hormonal pathways required for resistance. KPhi presented a systemic action and reduced disease severity up to 86% depending on the mode (foliar spray or irrigation) and time of application (3 or 7 days before inoculation). The compound reduced the concentration of phenolics and altered the activity of antioxidant enzymes, notably of catalase, whose activity was reduced even before pathogen inoculation, indicating a physiological effect. In addition, KPhi was toxic to the pathogen in an in vitro assay. Disease severity on plants that overproduce ethylene, are insensitive to brassinosteroid (BR) or do not accumulate salicylic acid was higher than in the WT, revealing that these hormonal pathways are involved in the reaction to P. infestans. The results indicate a possible mode of action of KPhi through the early accumulation of H2O2 and interplay with the salicylic acid pathway. This is the first report on the involvement of BR against this pathogen and the results point to a positive effect on resistance. This study extends the understanding of the role of KPhi as a disease control agent, confirming it as a good option to be used in the management of late blight. © 2022 British Society for Plant Pathology.

Grimes is a nitrogen-fixing legume common in several Brazilian states that produces fruit during the dry season when tropical forages tend to have low biomass production and nutritional value. The objective of this work was to evaluate the chemical and morphological characteristics of the C. acacioides tree for its use in silvopastoral systems and the benefits of including its fruits in ruminant diets composed mainly of tropical grasses. Thirty C. acacioides trees were randomly selected, and their dendrometric parameters and fruit production were collected. From the fruits, the contents of dry matter, crude protein, ether extract, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, lignin, non-structural carbohydrates, and tannins, were analyzed. The in vitro gas production technique was used to evaluate three treatments: CTL: 100% Tifton hay; 20CAC: 20% C. acacioides + 80% Tifton hay; and 100CAC: 100% C. acacioides. The C. acacioides trees had an average height of 6.6 m, a canopy area of 111.8 m2, and an average fruit production of 29.6 kg. The fruits had a high protein and non-structural carbohydrates content. The total tannins content was less than 25 g kg−1 of DM. A greater amount of short-chain fatty acids and microbial biomass was observed for the 20CAC and 100CAC treatments compared to the CTL treatments (P < 0.05). Our findings demonstrate that supplementation with only 20% of C. acacioides fruits in ruminants’ diet may improve animal nutrition, being a naturally occurring energy and protein supplement for grazing ruminants during the dry season. © 2023	Article	Scopus

The objective of this study was to evaluate the nutritive value of by-products including bean residue (BR), bean straw (BS), cassava bagasse (CB), corn straw (CS), orange bagasse (OB), peanut shell (PS), sugarcane bagasse (SB), soybean hull (SH), and sugarcane straw (SS). Chemical composition, in vitro degradability, and fermentative parameters were analyzed and subjected to multivariate and principal component analyses. Crude protein content was highly variable among by-products with BR and SH presenting the highest values (p < 0.001). These values did not differ between BR and SH, while the lowest values were observed in OB, PS, SB, SS, CS, and CB. Neutral detergent fiber content was higher in SB, PS, CS, and SS (p < 0.001), while greater in vitro degradability was found for CB, BR, OB, BS, and SH (p < 0.001). However, the in vitro gas production (p < 0.001) and total short-chain fatty acid concentration (p < 0.001) were higher in CB, BR, BS, and OB. Multivariate cluster analysis showed three distinct groups with the most degradable in group 1 followed by group 2. These results demonstrate that the by-products used in this study did not impair in vitro fermentation, and thus have the potential to be used in the diets of ruminants and to improve the sustainability of the livestock production sector. © 2023 by the authors.

To understand the paleoenvironment, sediment cores from B02SR (freshwater) and 07SR (saline-alkaline) lakes were analyzed, employing a combination of 14C dating, microfossils, geochemical, elemental, and isotopic analyses. The 07SR core recovered Late Pleistocene sediments (~ 23,440 cal yrs BP), and the B02SR core Middle Holocene sediments (~ 6080 cal yrs BP). The base of the cores consists of bedded sands with no organic matter, sponge spicules, or diatoms. Phytoliths suggest the presence of cerrado vegetation with seasonal floods, suggestive of a periodically inundated distal floodplain. We interpret that the two lakes sustain perennial alkaline geochemical conditions between ~ 3080 and ~ 1330 cal yrs BP. The Lake B02SR transitioned to slightly acidic waters with low electrical conductivity from ~ 1330 cal yrs BP to the present, probably associated with a connection to ephemeral shallow or perennial channels. Lake 07SR maintained consistent water chemistry throughout the record, suggesting that an isolated drainage pattern remained unchanged creating persistent alkaline conditions. Our results suggest that lake chemical changes were spatially variable in lower Nhecolândia in the Holocene, which has implications for ecosystem services. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

The Poços de Caldas municipality in Brazil is known for its mineral richness, including large reserves of REE. In this study, we report light REE (La, Ce, Sm, Pr, and Nd) in soils and plants collected in an area. Composite soil samples and plant individuals were collected, and total concentrations of LREE in soils were determined by wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF). The plant available LREE concentrations in soils were estimated upon the acetic acid method (F1 fractions) of the stepwise sequential extraction procedure, together with plant content that was analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The total sum concentrations of tested LREE in soils varied from 5.6 up to 37.9 g kg−1, the bioavailable fraction was ca. 1%, and a linear relationship was found between them. The only exception was Sm, whose availability was lesser and did not show a linear relationship. The concentration of LREE in non-accumulator plants varied from 1.3–950 mg kg−1 for Ce, La 1.1–99 mg kg−1, Sm 0.04–9.31 mg kg−1, Pr 0.1–24.1 mg kg−1, and Nd 0.55–81 mg kg−1. The concentration of LREE among shoots did not show a linear relation either with the available fraction or total content. The screening also revealed Christella dentata (Forssk.) Brownsey & Jermy, Thelypteridaceae family, as a promising hyperaccumulator species. The concentrations of LREE among shoots of six individuals of this species were in the ranges from 115 to 1872 mg kg−1 for Ce, La 190–703 mg kg−1, Sm 9–48 mg kg−1, Pr 32–144 mg kg−1, and Nd 105–478 mg kg−1. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

P is present at all cell membranes and integrates the structure of bones, being necessary its supplementation in ruminants due to the deficiency of this mineral in the pastures. One of the principal factors that compromise its metabolization are gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN). Thus, the objective of this study was evaluate the performance and metabolism of P through its distribution in the animal body, density of bones and muscles, dynamic fluxes, biological availability and half live of P, concentration of P in tissues and bones of lambs simultaneously infected with the most prevalent GIN to sheep, in tropical or subtropical areas, (Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis) using the isotopic dilution technique with 32P radioisotope. Twenty Santa Ines sheep with seven months of age and averaging initial weight of 30.8 ± 6.41 kg were used and allocated to one of two treatments. Ten animals were orally infected (a single dose of 30,000 L3 larvae of T. colubriformis + 10,000 L3 larvae of H. contortus), and ten animals were not infected (control group). During the experimental, samples of blood, feces, urine, and diet refusals were collected and weighting were performed. A computed tomography was performed twice, before infection and at the end of the experiment, to evaluate changes in body composition. On 64-d after experimental infection, animals received an intravenous injection of 32P solution, and 7-d after they received radioisotope injection. The experimental animals were slaughtered, and tissue and bones were collected for P concentrations. The results showed that the parasitic infection compromised the absorption of P, impairing the metabolism, decreasing the mineral bioavailability increasing P bones reabsorption, and reducing bones density, also negatively compromising the infected animal performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Cyanobacteria produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as the compounds β-cyclocitral and β-ionone, which comprise odors, off-flavors, defense compounds, as well as growth regulators. Therefore, the general objective of this work was to evaluate the VOCs produced by two strains of Microcystis aeruginosa, differing in their ability to produce microcystins (LTPNA 01—non-producing and LTPNA 08—toxin-producing). The analysis of VOC production was carried out in (1) normal culture conditions, (2) under different light intensities (LI), and (3) after the external application of β-ionone in both cultures. Results: The results showed that β-cyclocitral and β-ionone are produced in all growth phases of LTPNA 01 and LTPNA 08. Both strains were producers of β-cyclocitral and β-ionone in normal culture conditions. It was observed that the β-cyclocitral concentration was higher than β-ionone in all light intensities investigated in this study. Additionally, the strain LTPNA 01 produced more β-cyclocitral than LTPNA 08 at almost all times and LIs analyzed. However, the strain LTPNA 08 produced more β-ionone, mainly at the initial times. In addition, the experiment results with the external addition of β-ionone in the cultures showed that the strain LTPNA 01 produced more β-cyclocitral in control conditions than in treatment. Nonetheless, β-ionone production was higher in treatment conditions in LTPNA 08, indicating that the addition of β-ionone may favor the production of these compounds and inhibit the production of β-cyclocitral. Conclusion: Our results showed that some abiotic factors, such as different light intensities and external application of β-ionone, can be triggers that lead to the production of VOCs. © 2022, The Author(s).

Methods: Three 2 m soil profiles with significantly different total organic carbon TOC content but located on the same geomorphological unit were studied for δ13C isotopic composition to connect tree-grass patterns to TOC content. To gain insight into soil carbon stability, C/N, δ13C and δ15N were analysed for functional organic matter (OM) pools: free particulate OM (POM), occluded POM, base-extractable OM, and mineral-associated OM. Results: Small but abrupt shifts of δ13C with depth reflected simultaneous changes in tree-grass vegetation patterns over the past 10,000 years in all three profiles. These temporal changes were superimposed on spatial differences as indicated by consistent differences in δ13C values between the profiles, reflecting that site-specific differences in tree-grass patterns persisted over the past 10,000 years. Profiles with a historically larger contribution from trees (as evidenced by lower δ13C) had increased charcoal contents. Downward movement of charcoal by intense bioturbation occurred faster in the OM-rich soils as suggested by 14C dating. Conclusion: We found that long-term carbon storage in Brazilian Cerrado soils was a conjunction of wildfires, bioturbation, and local edaphic controls on tree-grass composition. Soils with an OM-rich thick A-horizon had more trees, more charcoal, and a higher activity of soil macrofauna, which was related to local differences in soil water availability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Biogenic methane production is mainly performed by methanogenic Archaea, which underscores the importance of understanding the drivers shaping microbial communities involved in the methane cycling and changes in methane metabolism. Here, we aimed to investigate the composition and structure of bacterial and archaeal communities in tropical soils in response to land-use changes, emphasizing the methanogenic communities. We collected soil samples from primary forest, pasture, and secondary forest of the Amazonian region and used a strategy based on the enrichment of the methanogenic community with three different methanogenic substrates followed by measurements of methane emission, quantification of mcrA gene copies by qPCR, and total 16 S rRNA gene sequencing (metataxonomics). We observed variations in the structure of bacterial and archaeal communities of soils under different uses. The richness of methanogenic communities was higher in pasture than forest soils and this richness remained during the incubation period, and as a consequence, the enrichment induced earlier methane emission in pastures-derived samples. Furthermore, pastures enrichments exhibited methanogenic archaea networks more complex than primary and secondary forests. In conclusion, pastures harbor a richer and more responsive methanogenic community than forest samples, suggesting that conversion of forest areas to pasture may boost methane emission. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH	Article	Scopus

The solution to mitigate these damages relies on techniques that improve soil health and the microbial quality of these degraded areas. Here, we demonstrate that the high nutrient and microbiological contents of Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE) can promote the development of trees used in ecological restoration projects. Methods: We used degraded soil from crops as control and ADE from the Central Amazon to conduct the experiment, using 20% of ADE as inoculum in degraded agricultural soil. Our goal was to assess whether a small amount of ADE could promote changes that improve plant development similar to its growth under a 100%ADE. We simulated conversion from pasture to forest restoration area by planting U. brizantha in all pots. After 60 days, we removed it and planted Cecropia pachystachya, Peltophorum dubium, and Cedrela fissilis. Results: Our results demonstrated that both 20%ADE and 100%ADE treatments increased pasture productivity and, consequently, soil carbon stock. Also, in these treatments, P. dubium and C. fissilis had better growth and development, with 20%ADE plants showing a performance similar to those planted in 100%ADE. Both 20%ADE and 100%ADE showed similar numbers of taxa, being significantly higher than in the control soil. Discussion: The 20%ADE was sufficient to increase significantly the microbial richness in the soil, providing several beneficial microorganisms to all tree species such as Pedomicrobium, Candidatus Nitrososphaera, and members of Paenebacillaceae. Nevertheless, C. pachystachya, a common pioneer tree in the Amazonian Forest showed a small response even to 100%ADE with a corresponding lower taxa number than the other two species. In conclusion, we point out that microbial structure remains very similar among plants but dissimilar among treatments, highlighting the role of ADE as an enhancer of plant development and beneficial microbiota enrichment in the rhizosphere. The use of 20%ADE was sufficient to alter the microbial community. Therefore, we believe our data could contribute to speeding up forest restoration programs by adopting new biotechnological approaches for forest restoration ecology.

Many publications (thousands of peer-reviewed articles) require more work to extract their precise concentration values (i.e., different units, inaccurate data), which makes them not easily exploitable. For this purpose, tables have been compiled from the literature data, including lipids, fatty acids, proteins, and carbohydrates composition and quantities in cyanobacteria. A lot of data (323) were collected after careful a literature search, according to selected criteria in order to distinguish separately cyanobacteria, and according to categories of genus and species and generate average values of the contents of these cell components. These data are exploited in a first systematic analysis of the content in types of strains. Our database can be a powerful tool for biologists, chemists, and environmental agencies to determine the potential concentration of high-value chemical building blocks directly from low-value bloom biomass, cell cultures, or debris in the sediment, offering the potential to minimize environmental waste and add value to the agro-industrial residues. The database can also support strategies for food manufacturers to develop new products with optimized properties for veterinarian applications. © 2023 by the authors.	Review	Scopus

However, the rhizospheric effect on the microbial community from distinct plant species belonging to the same genus is poorly understood. This study hypothesized that the rhizospheric microbial community differs between plant species from the Phaseolus genus (i.e. P. acutifolius A. Gray, P. lunatus L., P. vulgaris L., P. microcarpus Mart., and P. filiformis Benth.) and that these differences could be related to phylogenetic differences found in these plant species. The redundancy analysis showed a distinct microbial community mainly when comparing P. lunatus and P. microcarpus. The microbial richness and diversity varied among plants, where P. lunatus showed the highest richness and diversity and P. microcarpus the lowest. The abundances of specific microbial phyla varied between the rhizosphere of Phaseolus species. Actinobacteria was abundant in the rhizosphere of P. acutifolius, P. vulgaris, and P. filiformis, while Acidobacteria was abundant in the rhizosphere of P. lunatus. This study revealed that each Phaseolus species recruits a distinct microbial community in the rhizosphere, with the rhizosphere community of the domesticated species P. lunatus being the most distinct. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, laboratory-scale experiments were carried out in order to evaluate the efficiency of nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) applied on urea and ammonium sulfate nitrate (ASN) sources under three tropical soils (Typic Quartzipsamment, Typic Hapludox and Rhodic Hapludox–contrasting soil textures). Methods: Soil samples were incubated over 60 days and the content of nitrate (N-NO3−), ammonium (N-NH4+) and pH variations were assessed periodically. In addition, N-NO3− and N-NH4+ percentage and nitrification inhibition were assessed. Results: 3,4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate application delays the nitrification process across all three tropical soil types, being more evident in the sandy-textured soils (Typic Quartzipsamment > Typic Hapludox > Rhodic Hapludox). DMPP application reduced the N-NO3− and N-NH4+ percentage in both ASN and urea sources, mainly between 15 and 30 (ASN) and between 7 and 30 days after N fertilization (urea). However, 45 days after N fertilization, inhibition of the nitrification process by DMPP is unlikely, regardless of N source. Conclusions: The nitrification process tended to be more intense when conventional urea was applied compared to conventional ASN. Therefore, the use of DMPP would benefit more urea than ASN mainly in sandy-textured soils, where the nitrification was observed to be increased. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	Article	Scopus

Urochloa brizantha) and perspective for microspore in vitro culture	2023	Protoplasma	260	2		571	587	16	10.1007/s00709-022-01802-w	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135813362&doi=10.1007%2fs00709-022-01802-w&partnerID=40&md5=202448afaf466b78b98abc6e54772875	Brachiaria, a genus from the Poaceae family, is largely cultivated as forage in Brazil. Among the most cultivated varieties of Brachiaria spp., B. brizantha cv. Marandu (syn. Urochloa brizantha) is of great agronomical importance due to the large areas cultivated with this species. This cultivar is apomictic and tetraploid. Sexual diploid genotype is available for this species. The difference in levels of ploidy among sexual and apomictic plants contributes to hindering Brachiaria breeding programs. The induction of haploids and double haploids is of great interest for the generation of new genotypes with potential use in intraspecific crosses. A key factor for the success of this technique is identifying adequate microspore developmental stages for efficient embryogenesis induction. Knowledge of the morphological changes during microsporogenesis and microgametogenesis and sporophytic tissues composing the anther is critical for identifying the stages in which microspores present a higher potential for embryogenic callus and somatic embryo through in vitro culture. In this work, morphological markers were associated with anther and pollen grain developmental stages, through histological analysis. Anther development was divided into 11 stages using morphological and cytological characteristics, from anther with archesporial cells to anther dehiscence. The morphological characteristics of each stage are presented. In addition, the response of stage 8 anthers to in vitro culture indicates microspores initiating somatic embryogenic pathway. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

Therefore, areas under desertification have increased in the Brazilian semiarid region and it has negatively changed the soil bacterial and archaeal communities and their functionality. On the other hand, although restoration strategies are expensive and there are few soils restoration programs, some practices have been applied to restore these soils under desertification. For instance, conservationist practices and grazing exclusion have been strategically implemented, and they created a new altered soil condition for soil microbial communities, boosting soil microbial diversity. Here, we discuss the potential of these restoration strategies to recover the richness and diversity of soil bacterial and archaeal communities that were described through environmental DNA (eDNA) sequencing of soil samples. eDNA sequencing results show that areas where restoration strategies have been applied in regions under desertification in the Brazilian semiarid have increased species richness, diversity, and structure of the bacterial and archaeal community. In addition, network connectivity and functionality of the soil microorganisms have been improved over time. Altogether, we show that management strategies for soil restoration have positive effects on soil microbial communities and these effects can be monitored using the eDNA sequencing approach. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

The treatment of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] seeds with Zn, however, is still not well known as regards the uptake and mobilization dynamics of the nutrient during the germination process. This study aimed to evaluate the uptake and distribution dynamics of Zn applied to soybean seeds at two levels of vigor during germination using X-ray micro-fluorescence spectroscopy (µ-XRF). Zinc treatments corresponded to 0, 2, 4 and 8 g of Zn per kg of seeds. High and low vigor seeds that had been treated were located appropriately so as to promote germination. Zn intensity measurements with µ-XRF were taken in different parts (“regions”) of the seeds (seed coat, cotyledon, and embryonic axis) after 8, 16 and 24 h of imbibition and seedlings (primary root, hypocotyl, plumule, cotyledon, and seed coat) after 48, 72 and 96 h of germination. High vigor seeds showed higher Zn intensity in the embryonic axis in the first 16 h, while low vigor seeds showed higher intensity after 24 h. After 48, 72 and 96 h of germination low vigor seedlings showed higher Zn intensity than high vigor seedlings in the primary root. It was concluded that µ-XRF is an efficient technique for identifying variances in the dynamics of Zn uptake and mobilization during the germination of soybean seeds with different vigor levels. © 2023, University of Sao Paolo.

Finding easy-to-measure riparian features that indicate soil moisture regime in riparian ecosystem may of use in environmental management. In this study, we answered the following question: can streambank height, on which these riparian zones are, indicate soil moisture regime? By measuring soil matric potential (0.15–0.9 m depth) and water table depth on a weekly basis at three forested riparian zones on different bank heights (low, moderate and high) and under a similar soil type, we demonstrate that riparian zones on high-to-moderate streambank height (h ≥ 1 m) generally have lower water table compared to riparian zones on low streambanks (h ≤ 0.3 m). This difference on water table depth led to significant differences in soil matric potential as water table depth lowers. However, in order to predict soil moisture regime more accurately, streambank height must be associated with a detailed field description of local factors such as soil type which can help in explaining deviations from the expected pattern of soil moisture as shown in moderate and high. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

These two issues were addressed in this study by performing field drainage experiments in layered soil profiles (three layers) with different particle size distributions and different percentages of RF. Water contents (θ) and pressure heads (h) were monitored at different soil depths during drainage experiments (h ≥ −200 cm). Data of θ and h for a drier range (h < −5000 cm) were determined with a dew point potentiometer on disturbed soil samples. The unimodal and bimodal van Genuchten-Mualem functions were evaluated, and their parameters were optimized using the Hydrus-1D “Inverse solution”. The RETC curve fitting software was used to estimate the second set of parameters of the bimodal function. The parameters for the uni- and bimodal models (15 and 27 parameters, respectively) were repeatedly optimized by fixing some parameters while estimating others. The unimodal van Genuchten-Mualem function provided a satisfactory fit of θ and h measurements only when either drainage or dew point potentiometer measurements were used. On the other hand, the bimodal van Genuchten-Mualem function provided a satisfactory fit of θ and h measurements when both sets of data (drainage and dew point potentiometer measurements) were used simultaneously. Furthermore, the optimized parameters were physically consistent except for a few high saturated hydraulic conductivity values. Therefore, bimodal functions should be considered to represent the hydraulic properties of soils with RF. The problem of many calibrated parameters when using bimodal functions can be managed using sequential optimization, which allowed us to estimate 27 parameters for layered soils with RF successfully. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Although the effect of CTS application on the bacterial community has been studied, it is unclear whether this impact discriminates between the dominant and rare species. This present study investigated how the dominant and rare bacterial communities respond over time to different concentrations of CTS application (0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 tons/ha) for 180 days. The richness of operational taxonomic units (OTU) was 30-fold higher in the rare than in the dominant biosphere. While some phyla shifted their relative abundance differently in the dominant and rare biosphere, some genera increased their relative abundance under higher CTS concentrations, such as Nocardioides (∼100%), Rubrobacter (∼300%), and Nordella (∼400%). Undominated processes largely governed the dominant biosphere (76.97%), followed by homogeneous (12.51%) and variable (8.03%) selection, and to a lesser extent, the dispersal limitation (2.48%). The rare biosphere was driven by the CTS application as evidenced by the exclusively homogeneous selection (100%). This study showed that the rare biosphere was more sensitive to changes in soil chemical parameters due to CTS application, which evidences the importance explore this portion of the bacterial community for its biotechnological use in contaminated soils. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Here, we characterized the role of ARF8 isoforms in pollen fertility. By phenotypic and ultrastructural analysis of arf8-7 mutant stamens, we found defects in pollen germination and viability caused by alterations in exine structure and pollen coat deposition. Furthermore, tapetum degeneration, a prerequisite for proper pollen wall formation, is delayed in arf8-7 anthers. In agreement, the genes encoding the transcription factors TDF1, AMS, MS188 and MS1, required for exine and pollen coat formation, and tapetum development, are downregulated in arf8-7 stamens. Consistently, the sporopollenin content is decreased, and the expression of sporopollenin synthesis/transport and pollen coat protein biosynthetic genes, regulated by AMS and MS188, is reduced. Inducible expression of the full-length isoform ARF8.1 in arf8-7 inflorescences complements the pollen (and tapetum) phenotype and restores the expression of the above transcription factors. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that ARF8.1 directly targets the promoters of TDF1, AMS and MS188. In conclusion, the ARF8.1 isoform controls pollen and tapetum development acting directly on the expression of TDF1, AMS and MS188, which belong to the pollen/tapetum genetic pathway. © 2023 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

We hypothesized that the application of biochar and Trichoderma spp. would alter the soil’s chemical and biological properties. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we conducted a field experiment and evaluated the soil’s chemical and biological properties. Results: Our findings revealed that seven soil parameters, namely pH, P, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and total organic C, had a significant influence on the activity of acid phosphatase and urease. We further used machine learning models of soil properties to predict the efficiency of biochar and Trichoderma spp. in improving soil quality. These models demonstrated satisfactory performance in simulating the changes in soil properties induced by biochar, based on both predicted and experimental yield results. Conclusion: Overall, our study provides important insights into the potential use of biochar and Trichoderma spp. as sustainable alternatives to mineral fertilizer for increasing tomato yield, while also highlighting their effects on soil biological and chemical properties Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

Thus, we evaluated the interaction Cd-Se and the effects of soil pH in this interaction on plant availability of Cd and phytoextraction efficiency of Urochloa decumbens cv. Basilisk grown in Oxisol. Two soil concentrations of Cd (0.93 and 3.6 mg kg-1) and Se (<0.2 and 1 mg kg-1) and two soil pH (0.01 mol L-1 CaCl2) conditions (4.1 and 5.7) were considered. At both pH, Se supply increased the exchangeable fraction of Cd and decreased the residual Cd fraction. At pH 4.1, the growth of U. decumbens was impaired by Se addition, regardless of Cd exposure. The lower root growth and tillering of U. decumbens exposed to Cd disappeared at pH 5.7 due to uptake of low Se concentrations. Thus, the toxic or beneficial effects of Se on growth of U. decumbens used for Cd phytoextraction depend on the amount of Se assimilated. The Cd phytoextraction efficiency of U. decumbens was not improved by Se supply, regardless of soil pH.

However, its effects on the behavior of saflufenacil in soil are still unknown, affecting its agricultural efficiency and the risks of environmental pollution. Laboratory studies were carried out to determine the effects of altering six raw materials and six biochars obtained from sugarcane straw, grape bagasse, soybean husk, peanut husk, cassava bagasse and corn straw on sorption–desorption and to study the raw material and the biochar of grape pomace in 14C-saflufenacil biodegradation in tropical soil. Raw feedstocks and their biochars are very heterogeneous materials, exhibiting different physical and chemical properties. These differences can lead to a greater or lesser potential for application to the soil to get agronomic and environmental benefits. Raw feedstocks and biochars added to the soil slightly alter the soil fertility characteristics and contribute little to the increase in sorption (Kd, de 0.87–1.94 L kg−1) and the reduction in desorption (Kd, de 0.87–2.55 L kg−1) of saflufenacil. These effects are slightly more significant in biochar than in raw feedstock. The sorbed and desorbed percentages of saflufenacil in the soil are not consistently affected across materials. The sorption capacity of saflufenacil in biochar amended soil is 22.1–31.3% higher than in unamended soil. The desorption of saflufenacil in biochar amended soil is 17.9–33% lower than that of unamended soil. The addition of raw feedstock or grape bagasse biochar to the soil does not influence the mineralization or the half-life of saflufenacil in the soil, which ranged from 38 to 43 days in the studied treatments. The results of this study raise concerns about the persistence of saflufenacil in soil, which may pose risks of groundwater contamination, and for the planting of herbicide-sensitive crops in rotation/succession, mainly when saflufenacil is used in crop desiccation management. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.

Metabolized ethanol reduces NAD+ to NADH, affecting critical metabolic pathways. Here, our aim was to investigate whether alcohol is metabolized by bone marrow cells and if it impacts the metabolic pathways of leukocyte progenitor cells. This is said to lead to a qualitative and quantitative alteration of key metabolites which may be related to the immune response. Methods: We addressed this aim by using C57BL/6 mice under chronic ethanol administration and evaluating the metabolomic profile of bone marrow total cells by gas chromatography–coupled mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Results: We identified 19 metabolites. Our data demonstrated that chronic ethanol administration alters the metabolomic profile in the bone marrow, resulting in a statistically diminished abundance of five metabolites in ethanol-treated animals: uracil, succinate, proline, nicotinamide, and tyrosine. Discussion: Our results demonstrate for the first time in the literature the effects of alcohol consumption on the metabolome content of hematopoietic tissue and open a wide range of further studies to investigate mechanisms by which alcohol compromises the cellular function of the immune system.

These ancient prokaryotes are widespread in nature and can be found in virtually every habitat on Earth where there is light and water. They are producers of an array of secondary metabolites with important ecological roles, toxic effects, and biotechnological applications. The investigation of cyanobacterial metabolites has benefited from advances in analytical tools and bioinformatics that are employed in metabolomic analyses. In this chapter, we review selected articles highlighting the use of targeted and untargeted metabolomics in the analyses of secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacteria. Here, cyanobacterial secondary metabolites have been didactically divided into toxins and natural products according to their relevance to toxicological studies and drug discovery, respectively. This review illustrates how metabolomics has improved the chemical analysis of cyanobacteria in terms of speed, sensitivity, selectivity, and/or coverage, allowing for broader and more complex scientific questions. © 2023.

Then, these communities were transplanted to seeds to assess their effect on seedling development. The bacterial communities of inoculated soybean seedlings were assessed through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and seedlings’ growth was measured. The diversity in the bacterial consortium inoculum prepared from the rhizosphere was higher than those from the shoot. However, the application of bacterial consortium in seedling had no influence on diversity. The resulting bacterial community of seedlings inoculated with bacterial consortium presented an enrichment of specific plant growth-promoting groups, such as Gammaproteobacteria (Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Xanthomonas). The predicted potential functions showed an increased abundance of functions related to plant protection and nutrition. The application of bacterial consortium from the shoot of soybean plants grown in the soil with a previous history of soybean cultivation increased the seedling radicle length, hypocotyl length, and total dry weight by 44%, 30%, and 29%, respectively. Our study showed that selecting a consortium of indigenous microbes as inoculants is a potential approach to enhance the use and impacts of plant beneficial microorganisms on plant growth and possibly productivity. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

However, the extent to which these nutrients contribute to plants nutritional homeostasis remains poorly understood, as well as there is conflicting information about the interaction of these two nutrients, requiring a better understanding of nutritional homeostasis in different cultivars of cotton plants. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of Zn supply on the efficiency of P uptake and use in different cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars (IMA 8001 WS; TMG 44B2RF; FM 966). Plants were grown in Hoagland nutrient solution containing different levels of P and Zn (low and adequate supply). Biomass and mineral nutrition were evaluated in plants receiving contrasting levels of P and Zn supply. A balanced P and Zn supply (4 mM P × 4 µM Zn) enabled the highest biomass accumulation, while an imbalanced supply of these nutrients reduced P and Zn accumulation in the shoots in all cultivars. The TMG and FM cultivars grown under low P (0.5 mM) supply showed higher dry mass production and efficiency of P use when cultivated with adequate Zn (4.0 µM) than with low Zn (0.5 µM). The IMA cultivar demonstrated no effect of Zn on efficiency of P use. However, Zn supply in cotton increased P uptake in all cultivars grown with an adequate P supply. These results suggest that agricultural management strategies should aim for balanced mineral nutrition by considering cultivars to optimize yields and resource-use efficiencies. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Aerobic methane oxidation is a community function, with emergent community traits arising from the interaction of the methane-oxidizers (methanotrophs) and non-methanotrophs. Yet little is known of the spatial and temporal organization of these interaction networks in naturally-occurring complex communities. We hypothesized that the assembled bacterial community of the interaction network in methane hotspots would converge, driven by high substrate availability that favors specific methanotrophs, and in turn influences the recruitment of non-methanotrophs. These environments would also share more co-occurring than site-specific taxa. Results: We applied stable isotope probing (SIP) using 13C-CH4 coupled to a co-occurrence network analysis to probe trophic interactions in widespread methane-emitting environments, and over time. Network analysis revealed predominantly unique co-occurring taxa from different environments, indicating distinctly co-evolved communities more strongly influenced by other parameters than high methane availability. Also, results showed a narrower network topology range over time than between environments. Co-occurrence pattern points to Chthoniobacter as a relevant yet-unrecognized interacting partner particularly of the gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs, deserving future attention. In almost all instances, the networks derived from the 13C-CH4 incubation exhibited a less connected and complex topology than the networks derived from the unlabelledC-CH4 incubations, likely attributable to the exclusion of the inactive microbial population and spurious connections; DNA-based networks (without SIP) may thus overestimate the methane-dependent network complexity. Conclusion: We demonstrated that site-specific environmental parameters more strongly shaped the co-occurrence of bacterial taxa than substrate availability. Given that members of the interactome without the capacity to oxidize methane can exert interaction-induced effects on community function, understanding the co-occurrence pattern of the methane-driven interaction network is key to elucidating community function, which goes beyond relating activity to community composition, abundances, and diversity. More generally, we provide a methodological strategy that substantiates the ecological linkages between potentially interacting microorganisms with broad applications to elucidate the role of microbial interaction in community function. © 2022, The Author(s).

A key challenge regards the determination of plant mineral content, which help farmers to make a decision about fertilizer use. Currently, such nutritional status diagnoses are made based on wet chemical methods; they are usually slow and generate chemical wastess. In this context, an in-house manufactured XRF benchtop for agri-samples is proposed in this study. This XRF system was furnished with a manual primary filter changer, vacuum chamber, dual interlock radiological protection system, which were installed in the equipment cover, and light signals. Analytical capabilities were also evaluated. The equipment presented spurious peaks of Ti, Fe, Ni, and Zn, which is not ideal for some agronomical applications; this issue might be overcome in the future by means of additional primary filters. The total x-ray spectrum counting rate is roughly one magnitude order lower than two other commercial XRF systems, but the signal-to-noise ratio is quite similar. The vacuum chamber under partial vacuum improves the Al, Si, P and S signals from 1.5 to 2.2. The limits of detection (LOD, mg kg−1) for P (261), S (168), K (68), and Ca (50) macronutrients and Mn (14), Fe (15), Cu (9), and Zn (8) micronutrients are close to the ones reported in the literature. The limits of detection for P, S, K, and Ca are suitable for plant analysis. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	Article	Scopus

FC is primarily a function of soil hydraulic properties, whereas LP and WP depend on soil, plant, and atmospheric conditions. The difference between FC and WP is called total available water, whereas FC minus LP is the readily available water. The flux-based method (FBM) predicts PAW from unsaturated soil water flow, rooting characteristics, and atmospheric water demand.

The effect of three liquid diets on performance, incidence of diarrhea, and microbial community during diarrhea occurrence in dairy calves were evaluated. At birth, 35 dairy calves (20 male and 15 female) were randomly assigned to one of three treatments—refrigerated whole milk (WM), acidified whole milk (AWM), and milk replacer (MR). Intake, fecal score, and rectal temperature were evaluated daily, and performance and blood parameters were evaluated weekly during the preweaning period. Fecal samples from diarrheic calves were collected, and one initial and one final sample for each episode were selected. The bacterial community was assessed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene on the Illumina MiSeq platform and analyzed using the DADA2 pipeline. Calves fed WM had higher body weight at weaning, average daily gain, body measurements, and concentration of blood metabolites. The AWM-fed calves had a lower rectal temperature and fever days. Moreover, the MR-fed calves had lower beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration and a higher incidence of diarrhea. The fecal bacterial community of diarrheic calves showed dissimilarity among the AWM and the other treatments. At the compositional level, we observed a higher abundance of Fusobacterium and Ruminococcus genera (AWM), Prevotella (WM), and Lactobacillus (MR). In the AWM and MR diarrheic calves' feces, we also observed some beneficial bacterial genera. The performance and incidence of diarrhea of dairy calves were influenced by the liquid diet consumed and the bacterial composition of diarrhea. © 2022, The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

However, it may also contribute to environmental problems such as the pollution of soils with zinc and other potentially toxic metals. Our objective was to evaluate changes in the chemical speciation and mobility of Zn in a soil amended with phosphate. Soil samples were collected from a deactivated mining area in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and amended with NH4H2PO4 saturated with deionized water to 70 % of maximum water retention and incubated at 25 ± 2 °C in open containers for 60 days. The soil was chemically and mineralogically characterized, and sequential extraction, desorption kinetics, and speciation were carried out using synchrotron bulk-sample and micro–X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES/μ-XANES) spectroscopy at the Zn K-edge, and X-ray fluorescence microprobe analysis (μ-XRF). The combination of μ-XRF and μ-XANES techniques made it possible to identify Zn hotspots in the main species formed after phosphate remediation. The best fit combination for bulk XANES and μ-XANES was observed in Zn-montmorillonite, Zn-kerolite, Zn-ferrihydrite, and gahnite. In the course of phosphate treatment, gahnite, Zn layered double hydroxides (Zn-LDH), Zn3(PO4), and ZnO were identified by bulk XANES, while Zn-ferrihydrite, Zn-montmorillonite, and scholzite were identified by μ-XANES. Zinc in the phosphate-amended soil had the strongest partial correlations (r′ > 0.05) with Ni, Co, Fe, Cr, Mn, Si, P, Cd, Pb, and Cd, while the unamended soil showed the strongest correlation with Cu, Pb, Fe, and Si. The application of NH4H2PO4 altered Zn speciation and favored an increase in Zn desorption. The most available Zn contents after phosphate amendment were correlated with the release of exchangeable Zn fractions, associated with carbonate and organic matter. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to cyanotoxins, these bacteria produce a wide range of secondary metabolites with a wide repertoire of activities. The co-occurrence of cyanotoxins and other cyanopeptides during blooming is quite common, and the negative effects are not always limited to one class of toxins, which makes it essential to investigate the toxicity of the other compounds individually. The objective of this study was to isolate the cyanopeptide microcyclamide produced by the strain Microcystis aeruginosa LTPNA 08 by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry with a quadrupole-time-of-flight analyzer (LC-HR-QTOF-MS/MS) and to evaluate its acute toxicity in embryos of Danio rerio through the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity (FET) assay. The fraction containing microcyclamide (95% purity) caused lethality in 62% of the embryos after 96 h exposure (50 µg mL−1), with evidence of cardiotoxicity (cardiac edema). The calculated LC50 value was 42.98 µg mL−1 (with a concentration range of 37.79–48.89 µg mL−1). The characterization of the secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacteria and the investigation of the toxicity of these compounds individually are essential for the identification of the substances responsible for negative effects on living organisms and on the ecosystem, in addition to assisting in the development of risk management policies. © 2023 by the authors.

A diversity of analytical methods has been proposed for sample pretreatment (analyte extraction and sample mineralization), as well as for elemental determination. This wide availability of analytical alternatives makes the selection of suitable procedures a challenging task for the analysts. This review shows a critical evaluation of this issue, covering from conventional alternatives to innovative proposals aiming at faster and more environmentally friendly approaches. The literature survey demonstraded the predominance of microwave-assisted acid digestion for sample mineralization and plasma-based techniques for determination of macro and micronutrients (ICP-OES) and toxic species (ICP-MS). © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

To maintain and increase sugarcane yields in marginal areas, the use of nitrogen (N) fertilizers is essential, but N overuse may result in the leaching of reactive N to the natural environment. Despite the importance of N in sugarcane production, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in N homeostasis in this crop, particularly regarding ammonium (NH4+), the sugarcane’s preferred source of N. Here, using a sugarcane bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library and a series of in silico analyses, we identified an AMMONIUM TRANSPORTER (AMT) from the AMT2 subfamily, sugarcane AMMONIUM TRANSPORTER 3;3 (ScAMT3;3), which is constitutively and highly expressed in young and mature leaves. To characterize its biochemical function, we ectopically expressed ScAMT3;3 in heterologous systems (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana). The complementation of triple mep mutant yeast demonstrated that ScAMT3;3 is functional for NH3/H+ cotransport at high availability of NH4+ and under physiological pH conditions. The ectopic expression of ScAMT3;3 in the Arabidopsis quadruple AMT knockout mutant restored the transport capacity of 15N–NH4+ in roots and plant growth under specific N availability conditions, confirming the role of ScAMT3;3 in NH4+ transport in planta. Our results indicate that ScAMT3;3 belongs to the low-affinity transport system (Km 270.9 µM; Vmax 209.3 µmol g−1 root DW h−1). We were able to infer that ScAMT3;3 plays a presumed role in NH4+ source–sink remobilization in the shoots via phloem loading. These findings help to shed light on the functionality of a novel AMT2-type protein and provide bases for future research focusing on the improvement of sugarcane yield and N use efficiency.

In this study, we investigated the effects of different environmental conditions of six adjacent soda lakes in the Pantanal biome (Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil) on bacterial communities and their functioning using a metagenomic approach combined with flow cytometry and chemical analyses. Ordination analysis using flow cytometry and water chemistry data from two sampling periods (wet and dry) clustered soda lakes into three different profiles: eutrophic turbid (ET), oligotrophic turbid (OT), and clear vegetated oligotrophic (CVO). Analysis of bacterial community composition and functioning corroborated this ordination; the exception was one ET lake, which was similar to one OT lake during the wet season, indicating drastic shifts between seasons. Microbial abundance and diversity increased during the dry period, along with a considerable number of limnological variables, all indicative of a strong effect of the precipitation-evaporation balance in these systems. Cyanobacteria were associated with high electric conductivity, pH, and nutrient availability, whereas Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria were correlated with landscape morphology variability (surface water, surface perimeter, and lake volume) and with lower salinity and pH levels. Stress response metabolism was enhanced in OT and ET lakes and underrepresented in CVO lakes. The microbiome dataset of this study can serve as a baseline for restoring impacted soda lakes. Altogether, the results of this study demonstrate the sensitivity of tropical soda lakes to climate change, as slight changes in hydrological regimes might produce drastic shifts in community diversity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

We tested the hypothesis that C and N isotopic sign of leaves and soil and physiological traits of trees would vary from center to periphery in a megacity, considering land uses, intensity of automotive fleet and microclimatic conditions. 800 trees from four fragments were randomly chosen. Soil samples were collected at every 10 cm in trenches up to 1 m depth to analyze C and N contents. Both, plants and soil were assessed for δ13C, δ15N, %C and %N. Physiological traits [carbon assimilation (A)], CO2 internal and external pressure ratio (Pi/Pa) and intrinsic water use efficiency iWUE were estimated from δ13C and Δ δ13C in leaves and soil ranged from −27.42 ‰ to −35.39 ‰ and from −21.22 ‰ to −28.18 ‰, respectively, and did not vary along the areas. Center-periphery gradient was not evidenced by C. Emissions derived from fossil fuel and distinct land uses interfered at different levels in δ13C signature. δ15N in the canopy and soil varied clearly among urban forests, following center-periphery gradient. Leaf δ15N decreased from the nearest forest to the city center to the farthest, ranging from <3 ‰ to <−3 ‰. δ15N was a good indicator of atmospheric contamination by NOx emitted by vehicular fleet and a reliable predictor of land use change. %N followed the same trend of δ15N either for soils or leaves. Forest fragments located at the edges of the center-periphery gradient presented significantly lower A and Pi/Pa ratio and higher iWUE. These distinct physiological traits were attributed to successional stage and microclimatic conditions. Results suggest that ecosystem processes related to C and N and ecophysiological responses of urban forests vary according to land use and vehicular fleet. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

As a restricted range of residual free chlorine concentration at all points of the distribution network is needed to ensure efficiency and to avoid deleterious effects, fast and in situ quantification of this specie is important. This work deals with the development and validation of two procedures based on DPD (N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine) and OT (ortho-tolidine, 3,3-dimethylbenzidine) for the determination of residual free chlorine in water by exploiting a flow-based microdevice built with Low Temperature Co-Fired Ceramic (LTCC) technology. The analytical signal was monitored by a smartphone camera through RGB values obtained by a free application (Color Grab®). Under optimized conditions, linear ranges within 0.6–2.5 mg/L and 0.1–2.3 mg/L were obtained for DPD and OT methods, with limits of detection and quantification of 0.023 and 0.077 mg/L (DPD) and 0.026 and 0.089 mg/L (OT). Precision expressed as RSD (2.0 mg/L free chlorine, n = 10), was 1.3 % and 0.7 %, respectively. Both procedures were successfully applied to the analysis of samples from a water treatment plant. The flow-based microdevice coupled to digital-image colorimetry is an innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective analytical tool for in-field chemical analysis. © 2022	Article	Scopus

The increased demand for food, energy, and cattle activity has led to the conversion of natural grasslands to cultivated systems. However, the consequences of this conversion for soil microbial diversity and ecosystem functioning are yet to be discovered. Here, we used the 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and a large set of soil and environmental variables to understand the possible effects of natural grasslands to cultivated pasture conversion on the soil microbial structure, composition, diversity, and functions. The study areas followed a gradient of increasing soil disturbance intensity, as follows: Natural grassland (NG), Improved-natural grassland (IG), Perennial-cultivated pasture (PP), and Annual-cultivated pasture (AP). Natural grassland conversion to managed and cultivated pastures decreased the abundances of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, while increased α-, γ-, and δ-Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes, Patescibacteria, and Latescibacteria. The predicted functional profiles have also changed, as functions like ‘cellulolytic and symbionts/parasites’ decreased after natural to cultivated pastures conversion, while ‘nitrogen respiration’, ‘sulfur respiration’, and ‘aromatic compound degradation’ functions increased. Aboveground plant diversity decrease influenced belowground microbial diversity. The main drivers of diversity, composition, and functional potential are associated with soil attributes affected by liming, like aluminum complexation. In conclusion, we have found taxonomic and functional differences between natural and managed grasslands (NG and IG, respectively) and cultivated pastures (PP and AP), with consequences for management strategies and biodiversity conservation priorities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas some of its wild relatives are insect-resistant, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is not. Identifying the genetic changes that altered trichome development and biochemistry during tomato domestication would contribute to breeding for insect resistance. A mutation in the HAIRS ABSENT (H) gene, which encodes a C2H2 zinc finger protein (ZFP8), leads to reduced trichome density. Several geographic accessions of S. pimpinellifolium, the wild ancestor of domesticated tomato, have glabrous organs that resemble the phenotype caused by h. Here, we investigated allelic diversity for H in tomato and S. pimpinellifolium accessions and their associated trichome phenotypes. We also evaluated how the developmental stage can affect trichome development in glabrous and non-glabrous plants. We found that glabrous accessions of S. pimpinellifolium have different ZFP8 nucleotide sequence changes, associated with altered trichome development and density. We also found that while the glabrous appearance of h mutants is caused by a lower density of long trichomes, the density of type-VI glandular trichomes is increased, particularly in the adult stages of plant development. These insights on the genetic control of trichome development may contribute to breeding for insect resistance in tomatoes and other crops. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH	Article	Scopus

However, conservationist management could mitigate SOC losses, promoting the functioning and stability of agricultural soils. This study aimed to address the influence of conversion from native forest to different land-use systems on SOC fractions in Northeastern Brazil. Topsoil soil samples were collected in areas under pasture (PAS), no-tillage (NT1 and NT2), eucalyptus (EUC), and native forests of Cerrado in Northeastern, Brazil. Total organic C, microbial biomass (MBC), particulate (POC), and mineral-occluded organic C (MOC), as well as fulvic acids (C-FA), humic acids (C-HA), and humin (C-HUM) fractions were accessed. The results showed that land conversion maintained similar levels of humic fractions and total organic carbon (TOC) stocks in the PAS, NT1, NT2, and EUC as compared to native Cerrado. Soils with the input of permanent and diverse fresh organic material, such as NT2, PAS, and EUC, presented high levels of MBC and POC, and the lowest C-FA:TOC and C-HA:TOC ratios. The land conversion to agricultural systems that include cropping rotations associated with pasture species such as Mombasa grass and eucalyptus prevents topsoil losses of active C compartments in the Cerrado of the Brazilian Northeast.

The soil organic matter management is as old as agriculture itself. Recently, the use of soluble humic substances as plant growth promoters has been brought to attention due to their effects on nutrient uptake and water use efficiency. Humic substances applied directly at low concentrations can trigger different molecular, biochemical, and physiological processes in plants. However, how humic substances exert this plethoric regulatory action remains unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the transcription level of genes coding cell receptors, phosphatases, synthesis, and function of different plant hormones and transcription factors. Materials and methods: After seven days of humic acid treatment, we used RNAseq in maize root seedlings. The level of gene transcription was compared with control plants. Results: Plant kinase receptors and different phosphatases were regulated by humic acids. Likewise, genes related to plant hormones (auxin, gibberellin, ethylene, cytokinin, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, jasmonic and salicylic acids) were transcript in differential levels in maize root seedlings as well as the expression of a hundred of transcription factors modifying the signal transduction pathway via alterations of the subsequent gene response. Conclusion: We showed a general mechanism for simultaneously regulating the activity of several hormones where humic acids act as a key regulatory hub in plant responses integrating hormonal signalling and response pathways. © 2022, The Author(s).

Therefore, this study assessed the microbial community, by amplicon sequencing, in the rhizosphere of maize and cowpea growing in uncontaminated (∼6.0 mg kg−1 Cr) and Cr-contaminated soils (∼250 mg kg−1 Cr). Comparing Cr-contaminated and uncontaminated soils, the microbial community in the maize rhizosphere clustered separately, while the microbial community in the cowpea rhizosphere did not present clear clustering. The microbial richness ranged from ∼5000 (rhizosphere in Cr-contaminated soil) to ∼8000 OTUs (in uncontaminated soil). In the comparison of specific bacterial groups in the rhizosphere of maize, Firmicutes were enriched in Cr-contaminated soil, including Bacilli, Bacillales, and Paenibacillus. Cowpea rhizosphere showed a higher abundance of six microbial groups in Cr-contaminated soil, highlighting Rhizobiales, Pedomicrobium, and Gemmatimonadetes. The microbial community in both rhizospheres presented a similar proportion of specialists comparing uncontaminated (2.2 and 3.4% in the rhizosphere of maize and cowpea, respectively) and Cr-contaminated soils (1.8 and 3.2% in the rhizosphere of maize and cowpea, respectively). This study showed that each plant species drove differently the microbial community in the rhizosphere, with an important effect of Cr-contamination on the microbial community assembly. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

This is because pathogenic fungi compromise seed physiological quality and prevent the formation of plants in the field, which causes losses to farmers. Multispectral images technologies coupled with machine learning algorithms can optimize the identification of healthy peanut seeds, greatly improving the sanitary quality. The objective was to verify whether multispectral images technologies and artificial intelligence tools are effective for discriminating pathogenic fungi in tropical peanut seeds. For this purpose, dry peanut seeds infected by fungi (A. flavus, A. niger, Penicillium sp., and Rhizopus sp.) were used to acquire images at different wavelengths (365 to 970 nm). Multispectral markers of peanut seed health quality were found. The incubation period of 216 h was the one that most contributed to discriminating healthy seeds from those containing fungi through multispectral images. Texture (Percent Run), color (CIELab L*) and reflectance (490 nm) were highly effective in discriminating the sanitary quality of peanut seeds. Machine learning algorithms (LDA, MLP, RF, and SVM) demonstrated high accuracy in autonomous detection of seed health status (90 to 100%). Thus, multispectral images coupled with machine learning algorithms are effective for screening peanut seeds with superior sanitary quality.

However, it is necessary to evaluate the toxicological effects of TiO2−MWCNT towards safe and sustainable development of nanohybrids. In this work, we studied the cytotoxicity, protein corona formation and cellular internalisation of TiO2−MWCNT on fibroblasts derived from gonadal rainbow trout tissue (RTG-2) for the first time. This nanohydrid did not show any toxicity effect on RTG-2 cells up to 100 mg L−1 after 24 h of exposure as monitored by alamar blue, neutral red and trypan blue assays (in presence or absence of foetal bovine serum, FBS). Futhermore, cryo-transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that TiO2 particles is attached on nanotube surface after FBS-protein corona formation in cell culture medium. Raman spectroscopy imaging showed that TiO2−MWCNT can be internalised by RTG-2 cells. This work is a novel contribution towards better understanding the nanobiointeractions of nanohydrids linked to their in vitro effects on fish cells in aquatic nanoecotoxicology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Brazil has been restricting vehicular emissions for more than 30 years to minimize the impacts of fleet vehicles, but despite the restrictive legislation, several Brazilian cities still suffer from the effects of atmospheric pollution. The adoption of nature-based solutions (NbS) is being hailed as a sound alternative for improving urban air quality. In this sense, trees are a true reflection of the NbS concept since they can directly decrease PM levels by intercepting and resuspending particles, as well as altering pollution dispersion patterns. We wanted to understand the practical outcome of urban forest fragments as an NbS. Therefore, using litterfall in urban forest fragments, this study reported the role of green areas in reducing air pollution concentrations in 4 urban parks in Sao Paulo Megacity, Brazil. Air contaminants (Cd, Cu and Pb) varied from the edge to the core of urban forests. Multivariate analysis revealed that areas with different vehicle fleets influenced the input of air pollutants into these forest fragments. Our study further showed that trees serve as a natural barrier against PM. It can be concluded that this low-cost NbS alternative can reduce air pollution and has a potential to improve human health and well-being, and should be incorporated into municipal policies and programs, especially in critical locations of high human density. and poorly managed green areas. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

The cyanobacterial MAA biosynthetic cluster is formed by a gene encoding 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase (EVS) located immediately upstream from an O-methyltransferase (OMT) encoding gene, which together biosynthesize the expected MAA precursor 4-deoxygadusol. Accordingly, these genes are typically absent in non-producers. In this study, the relationship between gene cluster architecture and constitutive production of MAAs was evaluated in cyanobacteria isolated from various Brazilian biomes. Constitutive production of MAAs was only detected in strains where genes formed a co-linear cluster. Expectedly, this production was enhanced upon exposure of the strains to UV irradiance and by using distinct culture media. Constitutive production of MAAs was not detected in all other strains and, unexpectedly, production could not be induced by exposure to UV irradiation or changing growth media. Other photoprotection strategies which might be employed by these MAA non-producing strains are discussed. The evolutionary and ecological significance of gene order conservation warrants closer experimentation, which may provide a first insight into regulatory interactions of genes encoding enzymes for MAA biosynthesis. © 2023 by the authors.

Pre-chlorination treatment is excellent for cyanobacterial cell inactivation and dissolved cyanotoxins removal in water supply sources. This study aims to evaluate the pre-chlorination effect treatment on Microcystis aeruginosa cell integrity and its hepatotoxins (microcystins, MC) release and degradation on a laboratory scale. Loss of cell integrity is observed with increasing chlorine concentration. The maximum cell permeability without cell disintegration occurs at 2.5 mg Cl2 L−1. Degradations up to 70% and chlorophyll-a reductions over 70% are observed after 60 min exposure, with complete degradation at 2.5 and 3 mg Cl2 L−1. However, chlorine (Cl2) exposure over 40.66 mg min L−1 is required for microcystins MC-LR (i.e. radicals: leucine (L) and arginine (R)) and MC-RR (i.e. radicals: arginine and arginine) oxidation oxidation to concentrations below the legislation value for water potability. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Soil samples were collected in primary forest (PF), secondary forest (SF), agricultural systems (AG) and cattle pastures (PA). Archaeal community composition was revealed based on high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The results revealed co-occurrence of archaeal classes, with two groups formed: Thaumarchaeota classes, including South Africa Gold Mine—Group 1 (SAGMG-1), Crenarchaeotic group (SCG) and Crenarchaeota candidate division YNPFFA, with predominance in PF and SF; and Bathyarchaeota_unclassified, Methanomicrobia and Methanobacteria (Euryarchaeota) with the FHMa11 terrestrial group, with predominance in PA. The number of co-occurrences between groups was lower in SF, AG and PA (approximately 30%) than in PF. The qPCR analysis revealed that PF also had the largest number of archaeal representatives. Soil texture may be a limiting factor of interactions between groups since the most representative groups, SAGMG-1 and the SCG (over 20% in all sites), were positively associated with coarse sand, the soil factor most correlated with the groups (33% of the total). These results suggest that interactions between archaeal classes belonging to different phyla may be dependent on the number of individuals in the soil environment. In this context, differences in soil physical structure among the land use systems can reduce the representatives of key groups and consequently the co-occurrence of Archaea, which could compromise the natural dynamics of this complex environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

However, long periods of exposure to sulfonamides can cause adverse effects such as allergic reactions. This work aims to study dispersive solid-liquid microextraction as an alternative method for extracting total SAs in meat samples. The procedure uses a colorimetric reaction based on the formation of a pink compound (imine salt) to determine total sulfonamides (sulfamethazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfathiazole) with digital measurements. A linear response was observed between 33-233 µg kg-1 for total sulfonamides, and the coefficient of variation (n = 11; 67 µg kg-1 of total SAs) and the limit of detection were estimated to be 0.63% and 10 µg kg-1, respectively. For a 750 mg meat sample, 0.11 mg of 4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde, 2.60 mg of sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 275 µL of 1-butanol were consumed per sample, and consequently, generating only 335 µL of residue. Besides this, addition-recovery tests were performed, resulting in a 71-100% recovery range, indicating the trueness of the proposed method. ©2023 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.	Article	Scopus

B. thuringiensis (Bt) is well known for its insecticidal properties; however, its beneficial features are not limited to pest control. Our group has been studed the beneficial effects of Bt strain RZ2MS9 as growth promoter in a range of plant crops, including soybean, tomato, and maize. We recently demonstrated that bacterial IAA biosynthesis plays an important role in the ability of RZ2MS9 to benefit plant development. However, the molecular involved mechanisms in the IAA biosynthesis by this bacterium in the beneficial interaction with plants remain unclear. Here, we investigated the genetic basis of IAA biosynthesis by RZ2MS9. We knocked out the ipdC gene, involved in IAA biosynthesis via the tryptophan-dependent IPyA pathway, using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Our results showed that, by disrupting the IPyA pathway, the amount of IAA synthesized by the mutant RZ2MS9 (ΔipdC) in the presence of tryptophan drops 57%. The gene knockout did not affect the bacterial growth, but it did affect its ability to colonize maize. Moreover, deactivating the ipdC gene in RZ2MS9 significantly reduces its ability to promote maize growth. ΔipdC performed worse than RZ2MS9 in almost all evaluated plant parameters, including total root length, projected root area, lateral roots, aerial part dry matter, and germination speed index. Therefore, we demonstrated that tryptophan-dependent IAA biosynthesis via the IPyA pathway by RZ2MS9 is strongly influenced by the ipdC gene. Furthermore, IAA biosynthesis by RZ2MS9 is a major mechanism used by this PGPR to promote maize growth. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH	Article	Scopus

Review and experimental articles from the last five years were selected to recapitulate the reasons for interest in algae cultivation, for which we highlight the most valuable phytochemicals passing through their niches in the food market, their bioenergetic potential and the possible uses of algal waste biomass. In addition, we punctuate the advent of algae biorefineries. The objectives of this study were to list the main points related to interest in cultivation, drawing a parallel between the establishment of algae in the food market and its potential to establish itself in the energy market. It was concluded that the use of algae biorefineries has been used as a solution for the food, chemical and energy markets, despite the need for the development of broader research on industrial scale. © 2023 by the authors.

We analyzed the effects of a range of land-use and climate-change disturbances on fine-scale canopy structure using a large database of profiling canopy lidar collected from disturbed and mature Amazon forest plots. At most of the disturbed sites, surveys were conducted 10–30 years after disturbance, with many exhibiting signs of recovery. Structural impacts differed in magnitude more than in character among disturbance types, producing a gradient of impacts. Structural changes were highly coordinated in a manner consistent across disturbance types, indicating commonalities in regeneration pathways. At the most severely affected site – burned igapó (seasonally flooded forest) – no signs of canopy regeneration were observed, indicating a sustained alteration of microclimates and consequently greater vulnerability to transitioning to a more open-canopy, savanna-like state. Notably, disturbances rarely shifted forests beyond the natural background of structural variation within mature plots, highlighting the similarities between anthropogenic and natural disturbance regimes, and indicating a degree of resilience among Amazon forests. Studying diverse disturbance types within an integrated analytical framework builds capacity to predict the risk of degradation-driven forest transitions. © 2023 The Authors.

Therefore, eighteen Santa Ines, castrated male, six-month old, healthy lambs (initial body weight 22.4 ± 2.7 kg) were distributed in one of four treatments arranged in a 2 × 2 split-plot arrangement: Sufficient dietary P level and uninfected (SPui; n = 4), Sufficient dietary P level and infected (SPi; n = 5), Deficient dietary P level and uninfected (DPui; n = 4), Deficient dietary P level and infected (DPi; n = 5). Infected lambs received, orally, a single pulse dose of 40.000 T. colubriformis infective larval stage (L3). Animals were fed Tifton 85 hay (Cynodon ssp.; 60%), and cassava meal and maize gluten meal (40%). Measurement of nutrient apparent digestibility and nitrogen metabolism were performed in individual metabolic stalls. To achieve the trial results, it was measured methane emissions in respiratory chambers, urine purine derivatives, ruminal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), histological cuts of duodenal mucosal tissues and passage rates fluxes, analyzed by external (Yb, Cr, and Co) and internal (iNDF) markers. Statistical procedures were performed in R studio. The fixed main effects of treatment and the interactions were tested by ANOVA, and means compared by Duncan's test at 5% significance. Apparent digestibility was not affected by treatments, however, nitrogen retained decreased (P < 0.01) and urinary nitrogen losses increased (P < 0.01) in infected animals. Small intestine digesta content, empty segment weight, and length were higher in infected animals (P < 0.05). Passage rate was not majorly affected by infection or dietary P levels. Methane emissions, SCFA concentrations, and purine derivative excretion were also not affected by treatments. Regarding the histology, the vilosity weight (P < 0.05), and crypt depth (P < 0.01) decreased in infected animals. In conclusion, T. colubriformis infection can damage intestinal mucosa and affect nitrogen metabolism, but did not affect the digesta transit, and nutrient digestibility. The P dietary levels did not promote any modification in GIT physiological parameters tested in this study. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.	Article	Scopus

However, a holistic comprehension about PGPB-plant-microbiome interactions is still incipient. Furthermore, the interaction among PGPB and the holobiont (host-microbiome association) represent a new frontier to plant breeding programs. We aimed to characterize maize bulk soil and rhizosphere microbiomes in irradiated soil (IS) and a native soil (NS) microbial community gradient (dilution-to-extinction) with Azospirillum brasilense Ab-V5, a PGPB commercial inoculant. Our hypothesis was that plant growth promotion efficiency is a result of PGPB niche occupation and persistence according to the holobiont conditions. The effects of Ab-V5 and NS microbial communities were evaluated in microcosms by a combined approach of microbiomics (species-specific qPCR, 16S rRNA metataxonomics and metagenomics) and plant phenomics (conventional and high-throughput methods). Our results revealed a weak maize growth promoting effect of Ab-V5 inoculation in undiluted NS, contrasting the positive effects of NS dilutions 10−3, 10−6, 10−9 and IS with Ab-V5. Alpha diversity in NS + Ab-V5 soil samples was higher than in all other treatments in a time course of 25 days after sowing (DAS). At 15 DAS, alpha diversity indexes were different between NS and IS, but similar in all NS dilutions in rhizospheric samples. These differences were not persistent at 25 DAS, demonstrating a stabilization process in the rhizobiomes. In NS 10−3 +Ab-V5 and NS 10−6 Ab-V5, Ab-V5 persisted in the maize rhizosphere until 15 DAS in higher abundances compared to NS. In NS + Ab-V5, abundance of six taxa were positively correlated with response to (a)biotic stresses in plant-soil interface. Genes involved in bacterial metabolism of riboses and amino acids, and cresol degradation were abundant on NS 10−3 + Ab-V5, indicating that these pathways can contribute to plant growth promotion and might be a result of Ab-V5 performance as a microbial recruiter of beneficial functions to the plant. Our results demonstrated the effects of holobiont on Ab-V5 performance. The meta-omics integration supported by plant phenomics opens new perspectives to better understanding of inoculants-holobiont interaction and for developing better strategies for optimization in the use of microbial products.

Thus far, there have been several records of mycovirus infection in Colletotrichum spp., primarily by viruses of the Partitiviridae family. There have also been records of infections by mycoviruses of the Chrysoviridae family. Mycoviruses are (+)ssRNA and dsRNA genome viruses, which may or may not be enveloped. To date, no mycovirus with a DNA genome has been isolated from Colletotrichum spp. Typically, mycoviruses cause latent infections, although hypo- and hypervirulence have also been reported in Colletotrichum spp. In addition to its effects on pathogenic behavior, mycovirus infection can lead to important physiological changes, such as altered morphological characteristics, reduced vegetative growth, and suppressed conidia production. Therefore, research on mycoviruses infecting phytopathogenic fungi can help develop alternative methods to chemical control, which can cause irreversible damage to humans and the environment.

The tallest and densest mangrove forests in the Amazon occur on the Bragança Peninsula. However, road construction that occurred in 1973 caused significant mangrove degradation in the area. A spatial-temporal analysis (1986–2019) based on optical, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), drone images, and altimetric data obtained by photogrammetry and validated by a topographic survey were carried out to understand how the construction of a road led to the death of mangroves. The topographic data suggested that this road altered the hydrodynamical flow, damming tidal waters. This process killed at least 4.3 km2 of mangrove trees. Nevertheless, due to natural mangrove recolonization, the area exhibiting degraded mangrove health decreased to ~2.8 km2 in 2003 and ~0.73 km2 in 2019. Climatic extreme events such as “El Niño” and “La Niña” had ephemeral control over the mangrove degradation/regeneration. In contrast, the relative sea-level rise during the last several decades caused long-term mangrove recolonization, expanding mangrove areas from lower to higher tidal flats. Permanently flooded depressions in the study area, created by the altered hydrodynamical flow due to the road, are unlikely to be recolonized by mangroves unless connections are re-established between these depressions with drainage on the Caeté estuary through pipes or bridges to prevent water accumulation between the road and depressions. To minimize impacts on mangroves, this road should have initially been designed to cross mangrove areas on the highest tidal flats and to skirt the channel headwaters to avoid interruption of regular tidal flow. © 2022 by the authors.

However, to evaluate the contribution of two 15N-labeled fertilizers to maize nutrition is an expensive process, and it is challenging to manufacture 15N-labeled controlled-release urea (CRU) considering a polymer-sulfur coated urea (PSCU). The objective of this study was to evaluate, in a field experiment, two methods to quantify the N derived from the PSCU (NdfPSCU) in maize plant using two blends (70% PSCU + 30% urea (U) and 30% PSCU + 70% U) applied in three ways (incorporated, broadcast and split application). The first method quantifies the NdfPSCU by subtracting the total N uptake in the N treatment by the sum of the N uptake in the control treatment (without N-fertilizer application) and the N derived from the U (NdfU) in the plant quantified with 15N. The second method quantifies the NdfPSCU using 15N (precise and direct method). Despite the first method is less expensive than the second it underestimated the NdfPSCU in four maize growth stages in Rhodic Eutrustox soil, being necessary the use of 15N in the PSCU to quantify the NdfPSCU with blends of PSCU + U. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Here we produced tomato plants overexpressing the cytokinin-deactivating gene CYTOKININ OXYDASE 2 (CKX2). CKX2-overexpressing (CKX2-OE) plants showed an excessive growth of axillary shoots, the opposite phenotype expected for plants with reduced cytokinin content, as evidenced by LC-MS analysis and ARR5-GUS staining. The TCP transcription factor SlBRC1b was downregulated in the axillary buds of CKX2-OE and its excessive branching was dependent on a functional version of the GRAS-family gene LATERAL SUPPRESSOR (LS). Grafting experiments indicated that increased branching in CKX2-OE plants is unlikely to be mediated by root-derived signals. Crossing CKX2-OE plants with transgenic antisense plants for the strigolactone biosynthesis gene CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE (CCD7-AS) produced an additive phenotype, indicating independent effects of cytokinin and strigolactones on increased branching. On the other hand, CKX2-OE plants showed reduced polar auxin transport and their bud outgrowth was reduced when combined with auxin mutants. Accordingly, CKX2-OE basal buds did not respond to auxin applied in the decapitated apex. Our results suggest that tomato shoot branching depends on a fine-tuning of different hormonal balances and that perturbations in the auxin status could compensate for the reduced cytokinin levels in CKX2-OE plants. © 2022, The Author(s).

Large amounts of waste, such as sewage sludge, are produced annually, with their final disposal causing environmental pollution and hazards to human health. Sludge has high amounts of nitrogen (N), and, when safely recycled by applying it into the soil as composted sewage sludge (CSS), its residual effect may provide gradual N release to crops. A field study was conducted in the Brazilian Cerrado. The aims were to investigate the residual effect of successive applications of CSS as a source of N in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. BRS Estilo)-palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha (A.Rich.) R.D. Webster)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation under no-tillage. Additionally, N cycling was monitored through changes in N metabolism; the efficiency of biological N2 fixation (BNF) and its implications for plant nutrition, development, and productivity, was also assessed. Methods: The experiment consisted of a randomized complete block design comparing four CSS rates (10, 15, 20, and 25 Mg ha-1, wet basis) to a control treatment (without adding mineral or organic fertilizer) over two crop years. Multiple plant and soil analyses (plant development and crop yield, Falker chlorophyll index (FCI), enzymatic, biochemical, 15N natural abundance, was evaluated, root and shoot N accumulation, etc.) were evaluated. Results and discussion: Results showed that CSS: i) maintained adequate N levels for all crops, increasing their productivity; ii) promoted efficient BNF, due to the stability of ureide metabolism in plants and increased protein content; iii) increased the nitrate content and the nitrate reductase activity in soybean; iv) affected urease activity and ammonium content due to changes in the plant’s urea metabolism; v) increased N accumulation in the aerial part of palisade grass. Composted sewage sludge can be used as an alternative source to meet crops’ N requirements, promoting productivity gains and N cycling through forage and improving N metabolism.

Therefore, this study used electron beam (e-beam) to disinfect wort from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) molasses and investigate the bioethanol fermentation. Four treatments (T0 – T3) were carried out using ionizing doses of radiation through the electron accelerator: 0 (control), 10, 20, and 40 kGy. Total mesophiles, total bacteria, sucrose, glucose, fructose, phenolics, flavonoids, hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), and Furfural were measured. An alcoholic fermentation assay was performed after the irradiation process. The irradiated treatments showed no inversion of sugars and formation of the inhibitory by-products flavonoids, furfural and 5-HMF, except for the phenolic compounds. The lower dose tested (10 kGy) reduced more than 99.9 % of the total mesophiles and more than 99.99 % of the total bacteria in the substrate. In the fermentation, the irradiated worts presented similar (p > 0.05) yields (92, 93, and 94 %) and ethanol productivity levels (0.89, 0.88, and 0.87 g L–1 h–1, for T1, T2, and T3 respectively). However, all treatments presented higher yields and productivity (p < 0.05) when compared to the control (88 % and 0.85 g L–1 h–1), highlighting the possible use of e-beam in wort fermentation at a lower dose (10 kGy). This allows reduction in losses caused by microbial contamination, besides increasing fermentation yield and productivity with lower energy consumption. © 2023, University of Sao Paolo.

Urochloa) varieties on soil properties and microbiome	2023	Plant and Soil							10.1007/s11104-023-06225-x	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168575219&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-023-06225-x&partnerID=40&md5=d050c0d4c701461c1ed5f86c86b60b8f	Background and aims: The Brachiaria sp. (synonymous with Urochloa) is one of Brazil’s main grass species used in livestock production and has become the focus of breeding genetic programs to enhance its resistance to drought, flooding, and pests, as well as improving its palatability to animals. However, there is a limited understanding of how genetic breeding can affect the soil microbiome and its potential functions. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the impact of four different Brachiaria varieties on the soil prokaryotic and fungal communities, with focus on the N-cycle. Methods: We combined molecular techniques, such as quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing, to target prokaryotic and fungal communities and traditional soil and plant chemical analyses. The treatments were composed of the varieties of B. brizantha cv. Marandu (BM), B. ruziziensis (BR), Brachiaria spp. cv. Ipyporã (BI), B. brizantha cv. BRS Paiaguás (BP) and control without plants. Results: Our findings revealed that all varieties improved soil porosity, P content, organic carbon, and potential functions as Chemoheterotroph, Aerobic-Chemoheterotroph, and Pathotroph-Saprotroph groups. Soil acidity, nutrient availability, and porosity were the main drivers of the microbial communities. The study also identified the ability of each variety to recruit microbial nitrogen-fixers and ammonia-oxidizers. Conclusion: We highlighted that Brachiaria varieties can favor soil microbial communities related to the release of nutrients, resistance to pathogens, and environmental stress. Also, the BI variety showed a higher potential to improve soil quality by increasing soil porosity and potential AMFs. Besides that, all varieties showed some potential to benefit intercropping and crop rotation systems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	Article	Scopus

Therefore, it is imperative that modern society develop sustainable technologies to avert future environmental degradation and generate alternative bioproduct-producing technologies. A promising approach to tackling this challenge involves utilizing natural microbial consortia or designing synthetic communities of microorganisms as a foundation to develop diverse and sustainable applications for bioproduct production, wastewater treatment, GHG emission reduction, energy crisis alleviation, and soil fertility enhancement. Microalgae, which are photosynthetic microorganisms that inhabit aquatic environments and exhibit a high capacity for CO2 fixation, are particularly appealing in this context. They can convert light energy and atmospheric CO2 or industrial flue gases into valuable biomass and organic chemicals, thereby contributing to GHG emission reduction. To date, most microalgae cultivation studies have focused on monoculture systems. However, maintaining a microalgae monoculture system can be challenging due to contamination by other microorganisms (e.g., yeasts, fungi, bacteria, and other microalgae species), which can lead to low productivity, culture collapse, and low-quality biomass. Co-culture systems, which produce robust microorganism consortia or communities, present a compelling strategy for addressing contamination problems. In recent years, research and development of innovative co-cultivation techniques have substantially increased. Nevertheless, many microalgae co-culturing technologies remain in the developmental phase and have yet to be scaled and commercialized. Accordingly, this review presents a thorough literature review of research conducted in the last few decades, exploring the advantages and disadvantages of microalgae co-cultivation systems that involve microalgae-bacteria, microalgae-fungi, and microalgae-microalgae/algae systems. The manuscript also addresses diverse uses of co-culture systems, and growing methods, and includes one of the most exciting research areas in co-culturing systems, which are omic studies that elucidate different interaction mechanisms among microbial communities. Finally, the manuscript discusses the economic viability, future challenges, and prospects of microalgal co-cultivation methods.

It is often reported that the rhizosphere of different plant species selects their PGPR community, which promotes the growth of some more than others. In this greenhouse study using the same agricultural soil, we assessed the PGPR community in the rhizosphere of important plant species, including two cultivars (maize and cowpea) and one landrace (lima bean). The PGPR community structure differed between the rhizosphere the landrace and the cultivars, which presented similar community structures. The rhizosphere of lima bean showed exclusive PGPR groups (Streptomyces, Soliruborbacter, and Methylobacter), which are involved in resistance and stress tolerance in plants. The rhizosphere of both cultivars presented a similar relative abundance of Bacillus and Paenibacillus, groups involved in plant growth promotion by the production of antibiotics and biological N fixation. In addition, the cultivars presented more proportion of specialist microbes, and the community interaction was more complex than the landrace. The findings of this study expand the knowledge of the PGPR community in distinct plant species and confirm the significant effect of landraces and cultivars on rhizobacteria community selection. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

An increasingly used method for conducting functional analyses of a soil microbial community is based on the physiological profile at the community level. This method allows the metabolic capacity of microorganisms to be assessed based on patterns of carbon consumption and derived indices. In the present study, the functional diversity of microbial communities was assessed in soils from seasonally flooded-forest (FOR) and -traditional farming systems (TFS) in Amazonian floodplains flooded with black, clear, and white water. The soils of the Amazon floodplains showed differences in the metabolic activity of their microbial communities, with a general trend in activity level of clear water floodplain > black water floodplain > white water floodplain. The redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that soil moisture (flood pulse) was the most important environmental parameter in determining the metabolic activity of the soil microbial communities in the black, clear, and white floodplains. In addition, the variance partitioning analysis (VPA) indicated that the microbial metabolic activity of the soil was more influenced by water type (41.72%) than by seasonality (19.55%) and land use type (15.28%). The soil microbiota of the white water floodplain was different from that of the clear water and black water floodplains in terms of metabolic richness, as the white water floodplain was mainly influenced by the low substrate use during the non-flooded period.

The molecular mechanism underlying WUE remains underexplored in sugarcane. Here, we investigated the drought-triggered physiological and transcriptional responses of two sugarcane cultivars contrasting for drought tolerance, ‘IACSP97-7065’ (sensitive) and ‘IACSP94-2094’ (tolerant). After 21 days without irrigation (DWI), only ‘IACSP94-2094’ exhibited superior WUE and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency, with the net CO2 assimilation being less impacted when compared with ‘IACSP97-7065’. RNA-seq of sugarcane leaves at 21 DWI revealed a total of 1,585 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for both genotypes, among which ‘IACSP94-2094’ showed 617 (38.9%) exclusive transcripts (212 up- and 405 down-regulated). Functional enrichment analyses of these unique DEGs revealed several relevant biological processes, such as photosynthesis, transcription factors, signal transduction, solute transport, and redox homeostasis. The better drought-responsiveness of ‘IACSP94-2094’ suggested signaling cascades that foster transcriptional regulation of genes implicated in the Calvin cycle and transport of water and carbon dioxide, which are expected to support the high WUE and carboxylation efficiency observed for this genotype under water deficit. Moreover, the robust antioxidant system of the drought-tolerant genotype might serve as a molecular shield against the drought-associated overproduction of reactive oxygen species. This study provides relevant data that may be used to develop novel strategies for sugarcane breeding programs and to understand the genetic basis of drought tolerance and WUE improvement of sugarcane.

This study identifies paleoenvironmental changes during the last 23 000 years, based on a tropical mountain peatland record, in the Serra do Espinhaço Meridional in central-eastern Brazil. A multi-proxy approach was used that involved palynological analysis, stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N), geochemistry, radiocarbon dating and multivariate statistics derived from a peatland core from Rio Preto (Minas Gerais state). The study reveals a very humid and cold climate during the late Pleistocene, with an increase in temperature and decrease in humidity at the Pleistocene–Holocene transition. During this period there was strong instability in the landscape (episodes of erosion). At the beginning of the Holocene there was a reduction in humidity with greater landscape stability. The current sub-humid climatic conditions seem to have been established in the mid-/late Holocene, with periods of landscape instability. Our findings agree with other Cerrado records that contradict previously established hypotheses, such as the Amazonian Refuge and the Pleistocene Arc. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	Article	Scopus

It was based on the adsorption of the acid−base indicator phenol red to milk proteins, with the color of the suspension monitored by smartphone-based photometry through the RGB color system. Sample throughput of 30 measurements h−1, relative standard deviation of 2.0 % (n = 20), cost-effectiveness, low waste generation (570 µL per determination), and a broad analytical range (5.4 ≤ pH ≤ 7.2) were achieved. The procedure was applied for pH determination in raw and processed milk samples and the results agreed with near-infrared spectroscopy and potentiometric reference procedures at the 95 % confidence level. Relative errors were lower than 2.0 % with recoveries from 97 % to 106 %. A screening approach based on the analytical responses at G and B channels yielded the correct classification of samples masked with ammonium chloride, sodium hydroxide, urea, or formaldehyde, as well as acid and diluted milk, even when the pH of non-conforming samples was adjusted to the expected values (pH from 6.60 to 6.80). This advantage in relation to potentiometric pH measurements demonstrates the potentiality of the proposed approach for evaluation of microbiological contamination of milk. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In this context, digital-image photometry (DIP) outstands because of its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and portability. Typically, it involves external standard calibration (EC) based on single-channel measurements and is often prone to matrix effects. Alternatively, multi-energy calibration (MEC) has been successfully exploited as a calibration strategy to minimize matrix effects in spectrochemical analysis, as it relies on measurements at different wavelengths using a pair of calibration solutions containing the same amount of sample. Aiming at a simpler and more practical approach, the present work pioneeringly proposes multi-channel smartphone-based digital-image photometry to minimize interferences and matrix effects using the general concept of MEC. Analytical signals were based on the responses obtained at different color channels, RGB (red, green, and blue), CMY (cyano and magenta channels) and HSV (saturation values). The strategy was evaluated with model colored solutions (methyl red, brilliant blue dye, and nickel(II) sulfate) to establish boundary working conditions. For calibration solutions with a sample/standard analyte concentration ratio between 0.2 and 1.0, analyte recoveries in the 85–103 %, 92–104 %, and 87–113 % ranges were found for methyl red, brilliant blue, and nickel(II) sulfate, respectively. The method's feasibility was then demonstrated by determination of methanol in solutions containing different amounts of glycerol, and hydrogen peroxide in milk with different fat contents. Relative errors (Er) for determination of methanol were within 2–16 % and 17–48 % using the MEC strategy and EC, respectively. For determination of hydrogen peroxide in milk, Er achieved by the proposed approach were within 6–10 %, whereas values as high as 50 % were estimated with EC. Coefficients of variation (n = 10) and limits of detection (99.7 % confidence level) for methanol and hydrogen peroxide determination were 3.5 % and 7 mg/L, and 6.6 % and 1 mg/L, respectively. These results demonstrate the proposed approach is a simple, practical, and environment friendly strategy to minimize matrix and other interfering effects. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

CETS genes encode phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins that have a central role in the timing of flowering as florigenic and anti-florigenic signals. The great expansion of CETS genes in many species suggests that the functions of this family go beyond flowering induction and repression. Here, we characterized the tomato SELF PRUNING 3C (SP3C) gene, and show that besides acting as a flowering repressor it also regulates seed germination and modulates root architecture. We show that loss of SP3C function in CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutant lines increases root length and reduces root side branching relative to the wild type. Higher SP3C expression in transgenic lines promotes the opposite effects in roots, represses seed germination, and also improves tolerance to water stress in seedlings. These discoveries provide new insights into the role of SP paralogs in agronomically relevant traits, and support future exploration of the involvement of CETS genes in abiotic stress responses. © The Author(s) 2022.

We investigated the effects of diets supplemented with an alcoholic extract of Artemisia annua (ae-Aa) on gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota and intestinal morphology along with its effects on the growth performance of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Juveniles were fed with ae-Aa supplementation (0.00, 0.10, 0.25, and 0.50% in the diets) for 30 days. The different ae-Aa supply levels affected bacterial interactions, resulting in a more complex network and increasing the proportion of positive correlations between bacterial groups. The different amounts of ae-Aa caused variations in specific bacterial abundance. The phyla Fusobacteriota and Bacteroidota were dominant in the intestinal microbiota in all experimental groups. The abundance of bacteria belonging to Fusobacteriaceae, Stenotrophomonas, and Clostridium correlated positively with protein efficiency, specific growth rate, weight gain, and final weight, while the opposite was observed for Acinetobacter. Diets supplemented with 0.25 and 0.5% of ae-Aa increased (p < 0.05) perimeter, height, and thickness of villi, crypt depth, villus:crypt ratio, and number of goblet cells in the intestine of Nile tilapia compared to control group. Nile tilapia supplemented with ae-Aa at all levels improved growth performance (weight gain, specific growth rate, and protein efficiency rate; p < 0.05) and feed conversion ratio (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. The weight gain was about 21% better in supplemented fish with ae-Aa than unsupplemented ones. The ae-Aa supplementation of Nile tilapia for 30 days modulated the GI microbiota communities providing variations in specific bacterial abundance, affecting the bacterial interactions, resulting in a more complex, stable, and connected network while changing their intestinal morphology and improving the performance of the fish. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

A long-term series (1998 to 2019) of neutron activation analysis (NAA) of agricultural certified reference materials was investigated at the Radioisotopes Laboratory (CENA/USP). The average sodium mass fraction in SRM 1515 Apple Leaves and SRM 1547 Peach Leaves did not agree with the certified values and the discrepancy was confirmed by triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (TQ-ICP-MS). Long-term data showed a clear increase of Na mass fraction over time. Such behavior, corroborated by results from other authors, seems to confirm the hypothesis of migration of Na from glass bottle walls into the certified reference materials. © 2022	Article	Scopus

By using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cultivar Micro-Tom (MT) as a model system, we investigated the physiological and metabolic consequences of M. perniciosa infection to determine whether symptoms result from sink establishment during infection. Infection of MT by M. perniciosa caused reductions in root biomass and fruit yield, a decrease in leaf gas exchange, and down-regulation of photosynthesis-related genes. The total leaf area and water potential decreased, while ABA levels, water conductance/conductivity, and ABA-related gene expression increased. Genes related to sugar metabolism and those involved in secondary cell wall deposition were up-regulated upon infection, and the concentrations of sugars, fumarate, and amino acids increased. 14C-glucose was mobilized towards infected MT stems, but not in inoculated stems of the MT line overexpressing CYTOKININ OXIDASE-2 (35S::AtCKX2), suggesting a role for cytokinin in establishing a sugar sink. The up-regulation of genes involved in cell wall deposition and phenylpropanoid metabolism in infected MT, but not in 35S::AtCKX2 plants, suggests establishment of a cytokinin-mediated sink that promotes tissue overgrowth with an increase in lignin. Possibly, M. perniciosa could benefit from the accumulation of secondary cell walls during its saprotrophic phase of infection.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Yet, few studies have investigated how urbanization can influence the diet quality and trophic ecology of coastal sharks. In a preliminary study, we examined for spatial variation in the nutritional ecology of a highly active marine predator, the blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus) exposed to regional differences in coastal urbanization in southeast Florida. We used medium-term nutritional indicators (i.e., body condition and whole blood stable isotopes [δ15N and δ13C]) and short-term dietary markers (i.e., plasma fatty acid profiles) to test the hypothesis that blacktip sharks sampled within highly urbanized areas (hereafter, ‘urban sharks’) would exhibit higher body condition, but lower diet quality, compared to conspecifics sampled in areas exposed to relatively low levels of urbanization (hereafter, ‘urban sharks’). Our initial results showed that urban blacktip sharks exhibited relatively higher body condition, blood δ15N levels, and percentages of saturated fatty acids compared to non-urban sharks. Collectively, these results suggest a possible positive alteration in the amount of food consumed by blacktip sharks in the study region and/or in the caloric value of their prey. We also found lower percentages of bacterial markers and higher values of dinoflagellate markers in urban sharks. Accordingly, we did not detect an expected reduction in diet quality (in terms of essential fatty acids) in this highly active species exposed to urbanization, as has been previously reported in a resident shark species (Ginglymostoma cirratum). Therefore, it is possible that lifestyle and feeding behavior influence the quality of food consumed by urban sharks. We suspect that impacts of urbanization are more pronounced in resident, sedentary and benthic species. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Smaller habitat patches suffer greater external interference, being more susceptible to diversity loss and could also receive more trophic subsidies from outside or matrix, which can favour the maintenance of populations even in small patches. Natural mosaics of forest patches in a grassland matrix in southern Brazil are good places to analyse such a process. Our objective was to analyse the effect of habitat patching on trophic relationships based on the evaluation of two forest amphibian species (Physalaemus lisei and P. carrizorum) and compare those from habitat patches versus core/contiguous habitat. We compared isotopic carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen ratios (δ15N) in two anuran species as well the variation in their diet at different forest patch sizes. We chose carbon isotopes since they act as a proxy for inferences on the original habitat from which the matter flows towards the anurans, while nitrogen reveals their tropic level. Our results revealed that trophic sources for these amphibians derives predominantly from primary forest productivity. However, Physalaemus lisei δ13C values indicated that the contribution of grassland trophic sources in the diet was higher in frogs from forests patches (<100 ha) than in those from core forest habitat. In smaller patches, P. lisei consumed predominantly ants, which was the most abundant prey on habitat. On the other hand, in the core forest, where isopods were the most abundant prey, most of its consumption was beetles, spiders and ants. In contrast, P. carrizorum showed no significant changes in isotopic ratios or diet across habitats. Isotopic data suggested that both species occupied lower trophic levels in smaller forests than in core forests. Our data showed a tendency towards the increase of grassland contribution and decrease of amphibian trophic position in patched habitats in comparison to continuous habitat. © 2021 Ecological Society of Australia	Article	Scopus

The presence of BSEs affects leaf hydraulics and photosynthetic rate. The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) obscuravenosa (obv) mutant lacks BSEs. Here, we identify the obv gene and the causative mutation, a nonsynonymous amino acid change that disrupts a C2H2 zinc finger motif in a putative transcription factor. This mutation exists as a polymorphism in the natural range of wild tomatoes but has increased in frequency in domesticated tomatoes, suggesting that the latter diversified into heterobaric and homobaric leaf types. The obv mutant displays reduced vein density, leaf hydraulic conductance and photosynthetic assimilation rate. We show that these and other pleiotropic effects on plant development, including changes in leaf insertion angle, leaf margin serration, minor vein density, and fruit shape, are controlled by OBV via changes in auxin signaling. Loss of function of the transcriptional regulator AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 4 (ARF4) also results in defective BSE development, revealing an additional component of a genetic module controlling aspects of leaf development important for ecological adaptation and subject to breeding selection. ©American Society of Plant Biologists 2022.

Here, we assessed the effect of land degradation, restoration, and native forest on soil microbial communities in a semiarid region from Northeastern Brazil. Thus, soil samples were collected at 0–20 cm depth, in three sites: native, degraded, and restored lands. The soil DNA was extracted, and the microbial community was assessed by next-generation sequencing through the Illumina platform. The composition of microbial communities and their potential functions were altered by the degradation process, thereby decreasing microbial diversity. Also, the changes in the microbial communities seem to be related to soil chemical alterations, which were changed by the process of degradation and restoration. Land degradation led to a loss of diversity and functions, and the restored area presented more resilience, which suggests that the microbial communities could recover their functions by adopting sustainable practices. Importantly, degraded lands reduced functions related to chemoheterotrophic metabolism, which can strongly impact carbon dynamics in the system. Finally, this study provided relevant evidence that land restoration practices can recover soil functions, which is extremely relevant for further research that is aimed at the development of sustainable practices in degradation hotspots around the world. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The present study evaluated the effect of enrofloxacin residues' presence in the soil from irrigation water contaminated with this antibiotic on the alfalfa (Medicago sativa) biomass. The study was conducted in a controlled plant growth chamber for 40 days, where 12 flowerpots were distributed in 3 treatments with three repetitions and three controls. Plants were watered with 100 mL of type 2 water during the first 16 days and with 48 h frequency, followed by 200 mL of water contaminated with enrofloxacin with 2, 20, and 200 μg L−1 with four days frequency until the harvest on day 40. Our results showed that the presence of enrofloxacin in the soil reduced carbon fixation in stems and leaves of alfalfa by 6.14% when irrigation was with 200 μg L−1, compared to the control group; likewise, the number of nodules was reduced by 91% when the concentration was 200 μg L−1, and the root length is reduced by 32% compared to the treatment average. © 2022 The Authors	Article	Scopus

Production of viable pollen grains is required in at least one of the species involved, provided the other parental species is female-fertile. In this study, we assessed pollen viability in the South American native Saccharum villosum and in S. x officinarum (sugarcane), which are partly sympatric. Sex distribution in sugarcane hybrids and reproductive morphology of S. villosum were analyzed to verify potential conditions for interspecific hybridization. Five of the sugarcane hybrids were shown to be exclusive hermaphrodites, two of them protogynous and one protandrous, and three hybrids were shown to be gynomonoecious, all potentially able to receive and donate pollen. All hybrids have viable pollen grains, but at different degrees (ca. 4% to 62%). S. villosum produces more viable pollen than sugarcane in southeastern Brazil. Pollen grains in S. villosum are middle-sized (32-39 μm in diameter), monoporate, monadic, prolato-spheroidal, isopolar, with exine ornamentation consisting of ungrouped granules, being distinguishable from sugarcane pollen. Pollen grains in S. villosum are highly variable for the five internal traits measured, especially for nexine and tectum thicknesses. Seed development of S. villosum occurs before panicle emergence. A morpho-anatomical analysis of the germinated seed revealed that S. villosum has traits considered as derived within Poaceae, such as the lack of epiblast. However, this species is an early-divergent Saccharum member, based on a small relative embryo size. In conclusion, the absence of natural hybrids between sugarcane and S. villosum is more probably associated with either autogamy or agamospermy in the wild species rather than with pollen inviability or absence of pollen production in sugarcane. © 2022	Article	Scopus

This study focused on how land use (grazing versus cultivation in parallel soils, the latter under no-till with a seven-year history of ATZ application) and bacterial community diversity affected ATZ dissipation. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, and Gemmatimonadetes were the dominant phyla in both soils. The mineralization of ATZ was much higher in soils under cultivation up to the onset of moderate diversity depletion (dilution =10−3), corresponding to 44–52% of the amount applied (< 5% in the grazed soil). This was attributed to the higher diversity and complexity of the soils´ bacterial communities which consist of microbial groups that were more adapted as a result of previous exposure to ATZ. In these cases, ATZ dissipation was attributed mainly to mineralization (DT50 = 4–11 d). However, formation of non-extractable ATZ residues was exceptionally important in the other cases (DT50 = 17–44 d). The cultivated soils also presented a higher number of bacterial genera correlated with ATZ dissipation, in which Acidothermus, Aquicela, Arenimonas, Candidatus_Koribacter, Hirschia, MND1, Nitrospira, Occallatibacter, OM27_clade, and Ralstonia are suggested as potential ATZ-degraders. Finally, ATZ dissipation was mostly associated with an abundance of microbial functions related to energy supply and N-metabolism, suggesting co-metabolism is its first biodegradation step. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to evaluate the preferential uptake of ammonium and nitrate in sugarcane genotypes contrasting with NUE under controlled conditions. Four sugarcane genotypes previously selected by another experiment (ER: efficient and responsive; ENR: efficient and nonresponsive; IR: inefficient and responsive; INR: inefficient and nonresponsive) were grown in a growth chamber and fertilized with two 15N-labeled forms [(NH4)2SO4 (15N-NH4 +) or KNO3 (15N-NO3 -)]; soil was used as substrate. Plants were evaluated at three time points: 0, 24, and 72 h after 15N-fertilization. For the efficient genotypes (ER and ENR), the soil NH4 + levels were about 20% lower than those found for the inefficient genotypes (IR and INR) indicating greater N extraction by the plant. Nitrogen derived from fertilizer (NDFF) and 15 N recovery from fertilizer (15N RFF) in roots were influenced by the genotypes, in which responsive genotypes (ER and IR) presented a mean value 40% higher than the genotype INR, showing that greater absorption is more related to response than efficiency. Three days after N application, NDFF and 15N RFF from 15N-NH4 + were greater than 15N-NO3 - in 40% and 65% for the roots and aerial part, respectively. The results of this study confirmed that sugarcane presents preferential uptake of NH4 + N form 3 days after fertilization. The use of nitrification inhibitors can be considered for providing a longer NH4 + residence time in the soil, also contributing to augmenting the NUE in sugarcane. © 	Article	Scopus

Among the most important agricultural activities in Brazil, sugarcane production represents a large impact for economic development and for environmental conditions. Permeating sugarcane fields, several headwater streams can be affected by sugarcane cultivation, in special, aquatic biogeochemical cycles because of the deforestation, fertilization, crop residues and higher temperatures in the tropics. In this study, we analyzed the effects of sugarcane cultivation on methane fluxes and concentrations, assuming that carbon cycles are influenced by agricultural activities in headwater streams. Our study aimed to (1) measure methane fluxes and concentrations in tropical streams located in Southeastern Brazil, (2) Analyze whether seasonal cycles influence methane fluxes and concentrations, (3) Evaluate the influence of sugarcane cultivation on methane fluxes and (4) Analyze the association between water chemistry in the methane concentrations in tropical streams. We found mean fluxes of CH4 of 0.280 mmol m−2 d−1, with higher fluxes during the summer and in streams draining preserved catchments. The average CH4 concentrations were 0.695 μmol L−1, with higher values during the summer and in streams draining preserved catchments. Methane concentrations in the studied streams was influenced by dissolved oxygen (negatively), dissolved organic carbon (negatively), water velocity (positively) and conductivity (negatively). Methane concentrations were significantly higher than concentrations found in Temperate Grasslands, Savannas & Shrublands and similar to concentrations found in other tropical biomes (excluding Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests which receives large amounts of organic inputs). We conclude that sugarcane influence methane concentrations and fluxes in tropical streams by reducing the organic matter availability provided by the native vegetation in soil and water. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The evaluation of tillering, nutritional status and biomass yield of this grass, mainly along successive shoot regrowths, is not well studied so far. Thus, P. maximum Jacq. cv. Massai was grown for two periods in an Oxisol presenting bioavailable Cd concentrations varying from 0.04 (control) to 10.91 mg kg−1 soil. Biomass yield of leaves and stems’ growth has decreased under the highest Cd exposure, but it did not occur in the regrowth period, indicating that Cd-induced toxicity is stronger in the early stages of development of P. maximum. The tillering was not compromised even the basal node presenting Cd concentrations higher than 100 mg kg−1 DW. We identified a restriction on Cd transport upwards from basal node, which was the main localization of Cd accumulation. Apparently, P, K, Mg, S and Cu are involved in processes that restrict Cd translocation and confer high tolerance to Cd in P. maximum. The Cd-induced nutritional disorders did not negatively correlate with factors used to calculate phytoextraction efficiency. However, the nutritional adjustments of P. maximum to cope with Cd stress restricted the upward Cd transport, which decreased the phytoextraction efficiency from the available Cd concentration of 5.93 mg kg−1 soil. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Si is expected to broaden the limit from physiological stress of forages grown under water restriction, which may come from an improvement in the stoichiometric homeostasis of Si with N and C, favoring physiological aspects. This study assessed whether Si supply via fertigation improves physiological aspects and the water content in the plant by means of an antioxidant defense system and changes in the C:N:Si stoichiometry during the regrowth of two cultivars of Panicum maximum grown under two soil water regimes (70 and 40% of the soil’s water retention capacity). The forages studied are sensitive to water deficit without silicon supply. The application of Si via fertigation attenuated the water deficit, favoring plant growth by stabilizing the stoichiometric homeostasis C:N and C:Si, which are responsible for increasing the plant capacity of converting accumulated C in dry mass, favoring the water content of the plant tissue and the photosynthetic efficiency. This study highlights the importance of the physiological function of Si, and effects on the stoichiometry of C and N, which are neglected in most research on forages grown under water restriction. © 2022, The Author(s).

Outputs from 2009 to 2022 research metadata analysis	2022	Environmental Science: Nano	9	10		3711	3724	13	10.1039/d1en01078f	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138814433&doi=10.1039%2fd1en01078f&partnerID=40&md5=33744b830acea47c7083b2329c15287e	Agriculture is responsible for supplying food, feed, fibres, and an increasing fraction of fuel and raw chemicals for industry. Fulfilling such demands sustainably is one of the major challenges of our time. In this metadata analysis, we offer a quantitative overview of how scientists have been addressing the effects of nanomaterials on plants between 2009 and 2022. The analysis showed that cultivated crops (ca. 55%) and plant nutrients (54%) are mostly employed in the studies, pointing to the relevance of these aspects to agriculture. Nevertheless, it also revealed that the concentration of elements as nanomaterials is generally more than 2-fold higher than the elemental concentration applied as traditionally formulated fertilisers or those naturally found in soil. Furthermore, the median time span of most studies, i.e., 49 days for plants cultivated in soil, is still quite short compared to annual crop life cycles (90-120 days), and little attention (19% of treatments) has been devoted to soil microorganisms. Also, only a small fraction of experiments (6%) has been carried out under field conditions. Therefore, the data did not allow establishing correlations between effects and experimental parameters, such as concentration range, soil pH, or time of exposure. These observations point to the intricate relationship between our ability to infer conclusions and the experimental design employed. Finally, this comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the effects of nanomaterials on plant systems raises the question of whether nanomaterials will lead to incremental yield gains by replacing current inputs with nanotechnology-based ones, such as the controlled release of fertilizers and pesticides, or will disrupt agriculture by attacking problems so far not practically addressed, such as hacking plant stress and defence mechanisms or modulating metabolism and photosystems. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Subsequent crop breeding led to higher yields and facilitated population growth (Evans, 1998). Until recent times, both domestication and breeding occurred empirically with little understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. Today, we know that genetic variation is created by mutation and that breeding operates by stacking favorable mutations in a single plant through recombination. Technical advances will eventually allow controlled manipulation of mutation and recombination (Taagen et al., 2020; Nasti and Voytas, 2021), and thus de novo domestication of wild species by targeted modification of their genomes (Gasparini et al., 2021). Such tools will also aid in accelerating the improvement of traditional, semi-domesticated “orphan” crops that perform poorly in modern agricultural systems (Tadele, 2019). The combination of these approaches will help broaden the narrow genetic basis of crops on which humankind currently relies (Milla and Osborne, 2021). Furthermore, recent breakthroughs have shown that targeted control of gene expression is an even faster avenue to produce desirable phenotypes (Pan et al., 2021a), thus bypassing the need for mutation and recombination. However, the deliberate effort to create new crops or improve existing ones requires a thorough understanding of the genetic basis of domestication (Kantar et al., 2017). The synergistic combination of classical archeaobotany and genetics (Denham et al., 2020) with high-throughput genomics (Purugganan and Jackson, 2021) is revealing that a variety of different processes may have operated in the domestication of crops. This knowledge, combined with increasingly powerful gene-editing toolkits, sets the stage for the continual domestication of crop wild relatives and other lesser-known plant species by defining an ideal plant type (“ideotype”) that is more resilient, nutritious, and productive in a given environment (Zsögön et al., 2017). Wild plants that are naturally resistant to biotic (insects and diseases) and tolerant of abiotic (drought and heat) stresses can be selected and manipulated by introducing mutations that mimic the domestication events that led to improved yield and agronomic performance of the major crops of today. Proof-of-concept for the potential of this de novo domestication approach was provided using gene editing to create agronomically important traits in wild relatives of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) (Li et al., 2018; Zsögön et al., 2018), the orphan crop Physalis (Lemmon et al., 2018) and, more recently, in a polyploid wild relative of rice (Oryza species) (Yu et al., 2021). Here, we review how recent progress in the understanding of crop domestication and technical breakthroughs in gene-editing technology could be combined to produce better crops for the future. © 2022 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Thus, we investigated the agronomic efficiency of the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) applied in three tropical soils (Typic Quartzipsamment, Typic Hapludox and Rhodic Hapludox) cultivated with cotton plants, evaluating the fate of N (NH4+-N, NO3−-N, and total N in leached water and soil), N accumulation and N use efficiencies (agronomic, physiological, and recovery efficiencies). Five treatments were tested with each treatment consisting of two N sources applied, urea (U) and ammonium sulfate nitrate (ASN), either with or without DMPP application; an additional control treatment (absence of N application) was also tested. Leaching columns were used to assess NH4+-N and NO3−-N losses. DMPP improved the recovery efficiency from applied U and ASN fertilizers by reducing NO3−-N and NH4+-N leaching, leading to enhanced N acquisition from fertilizer and augmenting plant N accumulation and biomass. We found that agronomic efficiency in cotton plants increased from 4 to 52% with the DMPP + ASN source relative to ASN along the soil types. In addition, DMPP use increased agronomic efficiency from urea application from 32 to 91% relative to conventional urea. The use of DMPP would benefit from more urea than ASN mainly in sandy-textured soils, where the leaching losses were observed to be increased. The reduction in NO3−-N and NH4+-N losses highlights the potential of DMPP to mitigate the impact of N-based fertilizer application on N leaching, thereby improving agronomic efficiency, N uptake, and cotton growth–related responses under tropical soil conditions. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.

An environmental monitoring study was performed at the Billings Reservoir (at the water catchment site) to assess the water quality in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Physicochemical parameters were analyzed, quantifying the total cyanobacteria and the cyanotoxins microcystins (MCs) and saxitoxins (SXTs), as well as their possible ecological risk to the aquatic environment. We also determined metals and metalloids (As, Ba, Cd, Pb, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, and Sb) and fecal bacteria (Escherichia coli). Monthly samplings were performed for 2017, 2018, and 2019 (totaling 36 sampling campaigns). Metals, metalloids, and E. coli values were below the maximum limit allowed by the Brazilian legislation. High concentrations of total cyanobacteria (3.07 × 104 – 3.23 × 105 cells/mL), microcystin variants MC-LR (0.67–23.63 μg/L), MC-LA (0.03–8.66 μg/L), MC-RR (0.56–7.92 μg/L), and MC-YR (0.04–1.24 μg/L), as well as the saxitoxins GTX2 (0.18–5.37 μg/L), GTX3 (0.13–4.40 μg/L), and STX (0.12–2.92 μg/L) were detected. From an ecotoxicological point of view, the estimated values for the risk quotient (RQ) for microcystins and saxitoxins were largely greater than 1, indicating a high risk to aquatic life. Therefore, further efforts need to be made to delay the eutrophication of the reservoir. © 2022	Article	Scopus

Conversion of lands to OP plantations has been associated with compositional shifts of the microbial community, with consequences on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While the impact of the change in land use has recently been investigated for microorganisms involved in N2O emission, the response of the aerobic methanotrophs to OP agriculture remains to be determined. Here, we monitored the bacterial community composition, focusing on the aerobic methanotrophs, in OP agricultural soils since 2012, 2006, and 1993, as well as in a tropical rainforest, in 2019 and 2020. High-affinity methane uptake was confirmed, showing significantly lower rates in the OP plantations than in the tropical rainforest, but values increased with continuous OP agriculture. The bacterial, including the methanotrophic community composition, was modified with ongoing OP agriculture. The methanotrophic community composition was predominantly composed of unclassified methanotrophs, with the canonical (Methylocystis) and putative methanotrophs thought to catalyze high-affinity methane oxidation present at higher relative abundance in the oldest OP plantation. Results suggest that the methanotrophic community was relatively more stable within each site, exhibiting less temporal variations than the total bacterial community. Uncharacteristically, a 16S rRNA gene-based co-occurrence network analysis revealed a more complex and connected community in the OP agricultural soil, which may influence the resilience of the bacterial community to disturbances. Overall, we provide a first insight into the ecology and role of the aerobic methanotrophs as a methane sink in OP agricultural soils. © 2021, The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

Prediction models are an alternative to current laborious and costly in vivo CH4 measurement techniques. The objectives of this study were to: (1) collate a database of individual sheep records from CH4 emission studies conducted in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region; (2) identify key variables for predicting CH4 production (g/d) and CH4 yield [g/kg of dry matter intake (DMI)]; (3) develop and cross-validate these newly-developed models; and (4) compare models’ predictive ability with equations currently used to support national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories in the LAC region. After removing outliers, the final database retained 219 individual sheep records from 11 studies, 48.2% of the original database. Models were developed using a sequential approach, by incrementally adding different variables with increasing complexity. Production and yield of CH4 were predicted by fitting mixed-effects models with a random effect of study. The predictive accuracy of fitted CH4 prediction models was evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation. Overall, increasing model complexity improved the predictive performance of CH4 production and yield equations. Feed intake was the most important predictor of sheep CH4 production. Our best-developed CH4 production models outperformed Tier 2 equations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the growing lambs and mature sheep subsets, whereas they performed slightly worse in the complete subset. Methane yield can be predicted using dietary forage content only, or with an increased complexity model combining body weight, feeding level, and dietary forage content. The use of the newly-developed models rather than IPCC Tier 2 equations can substantially improve the accuracy of GHG inventories from LAC countries. © 2022	Article	Scopus

In this sense, the objective was to evaluate ruminal fermentative alterations and methane (CH4) production, as well as hematological and biochemical alterations in sheep submitted to a single mixed infection with 10,000 infective larvae (L3) of Haemonchus contortus and 30,000 L3 of Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Twenty castrated males Santa Inês sheep, seven months old averaging 30.8 ± 6.41 kg of body weight were used. Ten animals were infected, and ten animals were uninfected, in a completely randomized design. During the experimental period, blood and ruminal content samples were collected, as well as the leftovers and diet provided. Enteric methane (CH4) production of the animals was measured at the end of the experiment. Parasitic infection affected dry matter intake, decreased red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and packed cell volume (PCV), and increased eosinophils and platelets numbers (P < 0.05). Ruminal fermentative changes were also observed, with changes in the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production profile, increase in propionate and decrease in acetate, and higher CH4 production in infected animals. Thus, it is concluded that H. contortus and T. colubriformis mix infection in sheep reduces forage dry matter consumption, causes hematological changes and ruminal fermentation patterns, impairing nutritional metabolism with greater CH4 production by infected animals. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Slow-release fertilizers could address both problems. Here, the synthesis and properties of a zinc fertilizer composed of cellulose microbeads loaded with aqueous ZnSO4 are reported for the first time. UV-vis spectrophotometry showed that the beads immersed in water released all Zn2+ in about 30 min, regardless of the initial Zn2+ concentration. In two sandy substrates (a pure sand and a sandy loam substrate), microprobe X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy determined Zn2+ release from beads to the substrate corresponding to count rates of about 0.115 mm min-1 s-1, irrespective of the substrate and with a low sensitivity for the water content, except in a very dry range. These results indicate that these microbeads could represent a practical and sustainable solution for efficient nutrient supply in agriculture.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.	Article	Scopus

Their mechanism of action lies in their ability to inhibit enzymes involved in the folic acid cycle, especially human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR). However, most of them have a classical structure that has proven ineffective against melanoma, and, therefore, inhibitors with a non-classical lipophilic structure are increasingly becoming an attractive alternative to circumvent this clinical resistance. In this study, we conducted a protocol combining virtual screening (VS) and cell-based assays to identify new potential non-classical hDHFR inhibitors. Among 173 hit compounds identified (average logP = 3.68; average MW = 378.34 Da), two—herein, called C1 and C2—exhibited activity against melanoma cell lines B16 and A375 by MTT and Trypan-Blue assays. C1 showed cell growth arrest (39% and 56%) and C2 showed potent cytotoxic activity (77% and 51%) in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of C2 on A375 cell viability were greater than MTX (98% vs 60%) at equivalent concentrations and times. Our results indicate that the integrated in silico/in vitro approach provided a benchmark to identify novel promising non-classical DHFR inhibitors showing activity against melanoma cells. © 2022 by the authors.

Although this residue is biodegradable, it constitutes a potential source of environmental pollutants. To alleviate this issue, this biomass may be used in alternative applications; for example, it may be transformed into an enriched flour that can be used to improve the nutrient content in different foods. In this study, were evaluated the effects of drying processes on the relevant nutritional components in dry extracts obtained from the residue of fermented grape pomace. The concentrations of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins were higher when drying the flour by the traditional oven procedure than by freeze-drying. The highest difference (approximately 40%) was observed for tannin compounds. Therefore, drying in an oven is recommended due to the lower loss of bioactive compounds, in addition to being simple and cheap. © 2021, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).

Significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) were observed in the content of lipids, total dietary fiber, insoluble fiber, energy values, sodium, caffeine, and total phenolics, mainly in the product in which 15% (w/w) green coffee bean flour was added. Caffeine content was only detected and quantified in products with > 8% (w/w) green coffee bean flour, whereas the total phenolic content was detected and quantified in products with > 4% (w/w) green coffee bean flour. Thus, fortification of these products with 15% green coffee bean flour promoted a higher content of total dietary fiber and lower content of lipids, calories, sodium, and increased bioactive compounds. Thus, green coffee bean flour is an excellent alternative for the production of innovative foods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Sample preparation is a crucial step of the analysis to obtaining reliable data and minimizing interference owing to matrix effects. The present work studied the best sample digestion procedure for elemental analysis of Brazilian honeys from Tetragonisca angustula (Jataí) and Apis mellifera sp (Apis) by triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (TQ-ICP-MS). A central composite design with 2² factorial and 3 center points considering different volumes of HNO3 and H2O2 was investigated. There was no statistically significant influence of the amounts of HNO3 and H2O2 on the recoveries of Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, K, La, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Sr, Th, U, V and Zn mass fractions. Machine learning algorithms (Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) allowed discriminating entomological origin of honeys based on chemical profile with a classification accuracy of 99%. © 2022	Article	Scopus

Enhances Nitrogen Uptake and Yield in Field-Grown Cowpea and Did Not Change N-Fertilizer Recovery	2022	Plants	11	14	1847				10.3390/plants11141847	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136406176&doi=10.3390%2fplants11141847&partnerID=40&md5=bb761de5f52e6a98ea3fd631d0a27e73	This study was designed to investigate the effects of Azospirillum brasilense and Bradyrhizobium sp. co-inoculation coupled with N application on soil N levels and N in plants (total N, nitrate N-NO3− and ammonium N-NH4+), photosynthetic pigments, cowpea plant biomass and grain yield. An isotopic technique was employed to evaluate 15N fertilizer recovery and derivation. Field trials involved two inoculations—(i) single Bradyrhizobium sp. and (ii) Bradyrhizobium sp. + A. brasilense co-inoculation—and four N fertilizer rates (0, 20, 40 and 80 kg ha−1). The co-inoculation of Bradyrhizobium sp. + A. brasilense increased cowpea N uptake (an increase from 10 to 14%) and grain yield (an average increase of 8%) compared to the standard inoculation with Bradyrhizobium sp. specifically derived from soil and other sources without affecting 15N fertilizer recovery. There is no need for the supplementation of N via mineral fertilizers when A. brasilense co-inoculation is performed in a cowpea crop. However, even in the case of an NPK basal fertilization, applied N rates should remain below 20 kg N ha−1 when co-inoculation with Bradyrhizobium sp. and A. brasilense is performed. © 2022 by the authors.

These metabolites are the leading cause of off-flavor in fish from aquaculture facilities, even at small concentrations. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating the influence of tilapia production in cages on the availability and production of the metabolites GSM and MIB in water and sediment. Samples were obtained from two Brazilian natural tropical lakes (Palmas and Palminhas) in alternate months, in both dry and rainy periods. The physicochemical parameters of water and sediment samples were measured in situ and in the laboratory. Water samples were collected for quantitative analysis of the phytoplankton community, and fresh tissue samples from ten tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) to analyze semi-volatile compounds (GSM, MIB, and β-ionone). Samples from fish farms in Palminhas Lake present higher aqueous concentrations of phosphorus and ammonia, a higher abundance of Cyanophyceae, and the presence of GSM and MIB in sediment and fish flesh. Conversely, Palmas Lake presented low nutrients and a higher abundance of Chlorophyceae, with GSM presence and MIB absence. Therefore, eutrophication caused by fish farming in these tropical lakes with long water retention time coupled with inadequate governmental policies leads to negative feedback that leads to off-flavors in fish products. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

It has been observed that the number of studies dealing with the biodiversity of extremophilic cyanobacteria is limited while studies exploring their bioactive potential are even scarcer. The taxonomy of three Nostoc-like cyanobacterial strains isolated from a shallow lake in Brazil was studied by applying a polyphasic approach. The bioactive potential of the strains was also evaluated using antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The metabolites present in the bioactive HPLC fractions were identified by UPLC/ESI/Q-TOF. Based on our phylogenetic inferences in combination with morphological and ecological information, we describe Aliinostoc alkaliphilum sp. nov., exhibiting antibacterial and antifungal activities. The main bioactive metabolite in all three strains was nocuolin A, which represents the first report of this metabolite in Aliinostoc. Our phylogenetic studies also revealed that many bioactive metabolite-producting strains that are currently assigned to Nostoc belong to other distinct evolutionary lineages. These findings highlight the importance of polyphasic approach studies in both cyanobacterial taxonomy and natural product discovery programs. © 2022 by the authors.	Article	Scopus

Thus, the objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of the physicochemical attributes of soils in 14C-tebuthiuron behavior. All studies were carried out by radiometric technique. The Kf and Kd values of 14C-tebuthiuron sorption were 30% and 35% higher in clay soil (1.15 mg(1–1/n) L1/n Kg−1 and 1.32 L Kg−1) compared to loamy sand soil (0.80 mg(1-1/n) L1/n Kg−1 and 0.85 L Kg−1, respectively). The desorbed amount was ∼19% higher in loamy sand soil compared to loamy sand soil, and this process was influenced by OC and clay content. The 14C-tebuthiuron leaching in clay soil was up to 10 cm depth, while in loamy sand soil was higher, up to 25 cm, and this difference can be explained by high mobility and low sorption of herbicide in loamy sand soil. 14C-tebuthiuron had a long persistence in both soils (DT90 of ∼385 and 334 d in loamy sand and clay soil, respectively). Although, the microbiological activity in soils differed little in the presence and absence of herbicide. Soil type interfered in 14C-tebuthiuron behavior, and then the application recommendation of this herbicide as a function of the physicochemical attributes of the soil is an alternative to increase efficiency in weed control and reduce the risk of environmental contamination. © 2022	Article	Scopus

Thus, we assayed the nutritional status, metabolite profiling, and antioxidative responses in wild type and transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) containing the P5CSF129A gene under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV35S) or stress inducible rd29A promoters. The plants were exposed or unexposed to Cd (0 and 50 μmol L−1 CdCl2·H2O) for 24 and 72 h. The wild type plants were also treated with or without exogenous proline (1 mmol L−1). Plants supplied with exogenous proline exhibited lower Cd translocation from roots to leaves than plants overproducing proline, avoiding oxidative damages in the leaves of these plants. Meanwhile, tobacco overproducing proline was less susceptible to Cd-induced nutritional changes than wild type plants and presented better metabolic adjustment under Cd exposure compared to plants supplied with exogenous proline. Plants overproducing proline increased the synthesis of sugars and organic acids under Cd exposure, which contributed to absence of oxidative stress, since both superoxide dismutase and catalase were not active against Cd-induced oxidative stress in these genotypes. Plants overproducing proline under the control of rd29A presented higher proline concentration in comparison to the CaMV35S promoter. With exception of rd29A plants that presented high proline and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations, the other plants presented an inverse correlation between proline and GSH synthesis after 72 h of Cd exposure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

However, the migratory pattern of different mangrove species is still unclear, especially in the subtropical Brazilian littoral. This study utilizes pollen, diatom, and organic geochemistry to document the late Holocene morphological and ecological transformation in São Francisco do Sul Bay, the mangrove sub-range limit in south Brazil. This multi-proxy dataset indicates the establishment of saltmarshes and mangroves on muddy tidal flats at ∼1720 and ∼870 cal yr BP, and Laguncularia, Avicennia, and Rhizophora colonized the study area at ∼870, ∼390, and ∼70 cal yr BP, respectively. This stepwise succession of three mangrove species in São Francisco do Sul Bay, and poleward mangrove expansion toward the austral mangrove range limit, indicate that the migratory histories of different mangrove species were not synchronized during the late Holocene, and temperature is the primary climatic factor regulating the mangrove distribution in south Brazil. More importantly, the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Current Warm Period were clearly registered in the pollen record, suggesting that the two climate anomalies likely facilitated the mangroves colonization into higher latitudes in south Brazil. Overall, our dataset indicates that mangrove expansion into more temperate zones will likely accelerate in South America. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

The reconstructions are based on sedimentary, biological and geomorphological evidences. The data indicates sea-levels up to 2.9 m higher than the current one between the Mid- to Late Holocene, in agreement with the empirical sea-level envelope and with predictions of geophysical sea-level models for the Brazilian coast. The data suggests that there was little, if any, hydroisostatic compensation across 55 km of the continental shelf in the study area, between the archipelago and the mainland coast, given that similar elevations of the post-glacial sea-level maximum exist in both places. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

One of the main IVM-resistance mechanisms in H. contortus involves P-glycoprotein (PgP), a trans-membrane transport protein that rids worm cells from toxic molecules. This study aimed to evaluate the anthelmintic activity of IVM, alone or combined with main terpenes of essential oils (alpha-terpinene, beta-citronellol, beta-pinene, citronellal, limonene, menthol, and terpinolene) and with phenolic compounds (epicatechin, epigallocatechin, gallocatechin, pentagalloylglucose, procyanidin, and quercetin). All compounds were tested, alone or combined with IVM, against susceptible (HcS) and resistant (HcR) isolates of H. contortus through the larval development test (LDT) and the adult motility assay (AMT) using verapamil (VP), a known PgP modulator, as a control. Results for the LDT determined that the lethal concentration required to kill 50% of nematodes (LC50) with IVM was 10 times greater (0.01 µg/mL) for HcR than for HcS (0.001 µg/mL). The combination IVM + VP inhibited the activity of PgP in HcR resulting in a LC50 = 0.002 ug.mL−1. Although limonene was the least effective and alpha-terpinene the most effective terpene when tested alone against HcR, the best combinations were IVM + limonene and IVM + quercetin both produced LC50 = 0.002 µg/mL (similar to IVM+VP) which were chosen for subsequent tests. Because adult parasites are the final target for anthelmintics, IVM was evaluated in HcS (LC50 = 0.067 µg/mL) and HcR (LC50 =164.94 µg/mL) through the AMT. Results obtained with IVM + VP (LC50 = 0.020 µg/mL) in HcR were similar to IVM + limonene (LC50 = 0.028 µg/mL) and outperformed IVM + quercetin (LC50 = 1.39 µg/mL). RNA extracts from HcR adult worms exposed to IVM, IVM+VP, and IVM + limonene were evaluated for PgP expression by RT-PCR. For most concentrations, PgP-9 was significantly more expressed in worms treated with IVM alone than in worms treated with IVM + VP or IVM + limonene. Our results suggest that limonene is involved in the modulation of the PgP-9 gene and that it can restore the activity of IVM in the HcR isolate down to levels seen in HcS. Limonene is one of the main compounds found in citrus peel and has the potential to be both safe and affordable if used in combination with IVM to restore its anthelmintic effects against multi-drug-resistant H. contortus isolates. Our results also suggest that we may be more successful by combining natural products with failing commercial anthelmintics than trying to find natural substitutes for them. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

These organisms can form cyanobacterial blooms, which directly affect aquatic life. The present study investigated the mutagenicity of the cyanobacterium Sphaerospermopsis torques-reginae (strain ITEP-024), guanitoxin-producing (natural organophosphate), and sublethal effects on fish in relevant environment concentrations. For this, the Ames test (Salmonella/microsome) was performed as a mutagenic assay for extracts of the ITEP-024 strain. Specimens of Oreochromis niloticus (Teleostei: Cichlidae) were subjected to acute 96 h exposure to different concentrations of aqueous extract of the strain: C = control group; T1 = 31.25 mg/L; T2 = 62.5 mg/L; T3 = 125 mg/L; and T4 = 250 mg/L. Genotoxic, biochemical, osmoregulatory, and physiologic biomarkers were analyzed. Our results showed that the cyanobacterium had a weak mutagenic response for the TA102 strain of Salmonella with and without metabolic activation by S9. Strains TA98 and TA100 were not affected. Fish from treatments T3 and T4 showed changes in oxidative stress (CAT, SOD, and GST enzymes), inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase activity, micronucleus formation, and osmoregulatory disorders. No guanitoxin accumulation was detected in the different tissues of O. niloticus by LC-MS/MS. Our results showed unprecedented mutagenicity data of the guanitoxin-producing cyanobacteria by the Ames test and biochemical, osmoregulatory, and genotoxic disorders in fish, providing efficient aquatic contamination biomarkers. Despite the great concern related to the presence of guanitoxin in blooms in freshwater ecosystems, its concentration is not yet regulated, and thus there is no monitoring agenda in current legislation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Five peak rainfall profiles and one sine-wave rainfall profile, all with a cumulative rainfall amount of 28.8 cm and a duration of 24 h were used. Discrete rainfall profiles were generated based on the peak rainfall profiles for several step sizes. The rainfall profiles were evaluated in a sandy loam with a high saturated hydraulic conductivity and a silt loam with a low saturated hydraulic conductivity for two initial pressure heads. For both models, insensitivity was found below a critical step size Dcrit, whereas high sensitivity was observed above it, Dcrit depending on soil hydraulic conductivity and rainfall peak intensity, regardless of initial pressure head. In the sandy loam, Dcrit was 20–30 (high-intensity peak) and 70 min (low-intensity peak); in the silt loam, values were 100 and 200–300 min, respectively. Therefore, rainfall data from common weather station data at D = 60 min allow accurate estimates of infiltration only in low-conductivity soils or for low-intensity rainfall. The disaggregation of daily cumulative rainfall into sine-wave profiles improved predictions in more conductive soils. Results indicate that higher saturated hydraulic conductivity and intensity peak rainfall rate require smaller values of D for the accurate modelling of infiltration with Hydrus-1D and Green-Ampt models. Highlights: Temporal resolution of rainfall data is important in infiltration modelling. Temporal resolution of rainfall data affects Green-Ampt and Hydrus-1D predicted infiltration Green-Ampt and Hydrus-1D cumulative infiltration predictions are insensitive for rainfall resolution ≤20 min Predictions are more sensitive to rainfall resolution >20 min in soils with higher hydraulic conductivity. © 2022 British Society of Soil Science.

Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) can be a more effective and environmentally friendly process than traditional extraction (TE), which uses a large volume of solvent and conduction heating. Freshwater phytoplankton inhabits diverse aquatic environments and is a promising source of fatty acids and green precursors in the synthesis of biofuel, including cyanobacterial biomass. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential of MAE to extract fatty acids from a Chlorella sp. microalga and two cyanobacteria, namely, Arthrospira sp. and Sphaerospermopsis torques-reginae, for biodiesel production. For this purpose, the lipid content and fatty acid profile of these strains were compared after treating biomass with the two extraction methods. (2) Methods: MAE and TE were used as extraction procedures; gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was used to assess the fatty acid profiles, and X-ray spectroscopy was used to analyze biomass. (3) Results: Although the fatty acid profile of the oil obtained by TE showed higher concentrations of fatty acids, the MAE method was able to extract more types of fatty acids. The variety of fatty acids extracted by the MAE, especially those with unsaturated chains, allowed for better quality biodiesel, presenting advantages over previous methods and studies. According to the analyses, essential fatty acids 16:0, 16:1, and 18:2 were found to be abundant in both cyanobacterial strains and in microalga, showing potential for biofuel production. Additionally, metal composition was determined as its content may indicate potential pro-oxidant influence in biofuel production. (4) Conclusions: MAE is a useful and green strategy to extract fatty acids from freshwater phytoplankton. Cyanobacteria can also be a beneficial source of fatty acids for biodiesel synthesis. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	Article	Scopus

The objective of applying N on live forage grasses or their residues to no-till (NT) systems is to promote the gradual release of N via straw decomposition to the subsequent crop. However, the N use efficiency by the subsequent crop under early fertilization has not been determined in the end of growing season. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the most cultivated tropical forage grasses can supply the N demand and enhance the grain yields of maize via the N recovery when N is applied with different timings than the conventional method. A 3-year field experiment was performed using palisade grass [(Urochloa brizantha (syn. Brachiaria)] and ruzigrass (U. ruziziensis) as cover crops with four N application timings to agricultural system: (i) no-N, zero N application; (ii) CC+N, 120 kg N ha−1 applied on live cover crops 35 days before maize seeding; (iii) St+N, 120 kg N ha−1 applied on cover crops straw 1 day before seeding; and (iii) Nv4, conventional method of sidedress N application at the maize V4 (four leaf) growth stage. Except control, all N treatments received 40 kg N ha−1at maize seeding, totalizing 160 kg N ha−1. Straw decomposition and cover crop N accumulation were greater in the treatments in which N fertilizer was applied on palisade grass compared with ruzigrass. High maize yields were achieved with N application on palisade grass or its residues or according to the conventional method, with yields of 13.2, 13.2 and 13.6 Mg ha−1, respectively. Similarly, high maize yields were obtained when N was applied on ruzigrass residues or according to the conventional method (12.1 and 11.8 Mg ha−1, respectively). However, regardless of cover crop species, N recovery was highest when N fertilizer was applied via the conventional method. Additionally, most of the N in maize at harvest came from the soil when N fertilizer was applied to live palisade grass. Thus, best recovery of N fertilizer in the grain occurred in maize fertilized using the conventional method. Our results indicate that agricultural systems characterized by high dry matter from palisade grass have the potential to recycle and supply N to subsequent maize. Although palisade grass combined with early N fertilizer application may enhance maize response and yield, the current conventional method of N fertilizer application on maize allows higher recovery from N fertilizer while increasing the maize yield in tropical food production. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Although the impacts of deforestation are well studied, multiple land-use and land-cover transitions (LULCTs) occur in tropical landscapes, and we do not know how LULCTs differ in their rates or impacts on key ecosystem components. Here, we quantified the impacts of 18 LULCTs on three ecosystem components (biodiversity, carbon, and soil), based on 18 variables collected from 310 sites in the Brazilian Amazon. Across all LULCTs, biodiversity was the most affected ecosystem component, followed by carbon stocks, but the magnitude of change differed widely among LULCTs and individual variables. Forest clearance for pasture was the most prevalent and high-impact transition, but we also identified other LULCTs with high impact but lower prevalence (e.g., forest to agriculture). Our study demonstrates the importance of considering multiple ecosystem components and LULCTs to understand the consequences of human activities in tropical landscapes.

Although public health agencies monitor the causal toxins of most cyanoHABs and scientists in the field continue developing precise detection and prediction tools, the potent anticholinesterase neurotoxin, guanitoxin, is not presently environmentally monitored. This is largely due to its incompatibility with widely employed analytical methods and instability in the environment, despite guanitoxin being among the most lethal cyanotoxins. Here, we describe the guanitoxin biosynthesis gene cluster and its rigorously characterized nine-step metabolic pathway from l-arginine in the cyanobacterium Sphaerospermopsis torques-reginae ITEP-024. Through environmental sequencing data sets, guanitoxin (gnt) biosynthetic genes are repeatedly detected and expressed in municipal freshwater bodies that have undergone past toxic events. Knowledge of the genetic basis of guanitoxin biosynthesis now allows for environmental, biosynthetic gene monitoring to establish the global scope of this neurotoxic organophosphate. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Passion fruit (Passiflora spp) is an economic tropical fruit crop, but there is hardly any knowledge available about the molecular control of phase transition and flower initiation in this species. The florigen agent FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) interacts with the bZIP protein FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD) to induce flowering in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Current models based on research in rice suggest that this interaction is bridged by 14–3-3 proteins. We identified eight FT/TFL1 family members in Passiflora organensis and characterized them by analyzing their phylogeny, gene structure, expression patterns, protein interactions and putative biological roles by heterologous expression in Arabidopsis. PoFT was highest expressed during the adult vegetative phase and it is supposed to have an important role in flowering induction. In contrast, its paralogs PoTSFs were highest expressed in the reproductive phase. While ectopic expression of PoFT in transgenic Arabidopsis plants induced early flowering and inflorescence determinacy, the ectopic expression of PoTSFa caused a delay in flowering. PoTFL1-like genes were highest expressed during the juvenile phase and their ectopic expression caused delayed flowering in Arabidopsis. Our protein–protein interaction studies indicate that the flowering activation complexes in Passiflora might deviate from the hexameric complex found in the model system rice. Our results provide insights into the potential functions of FT/TFL1 gene family members during floral initiation and their implications in the special plant architecture of Passiflora species, contributing to more detailed studies on the regulation of passion fruit reproduction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry is an efficient technique to access metabolites from fractions and even environmental crude extracts. Nevertheless, metabolomics is limited in predicting structures or bioactivities for cryptic metabolites. Efficiently linking the biosynthetic potential inferred from (meta)genomics to the specialized metabolome would accelerate drug discovery programs by allowing metabolomics to make use of genetic predictions. Here, we present a k-nearest neighbor classifier to systematically connect mass spectrometry fragmentation spectra to their corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters (independent of their chemical class). Our new pattern-based genome mining pipeline links biosynthetic genes to metabolites that they encode for, as detected via mass spectrometry from bacterial cultures or environmental microbiomes. Using paired datasets that include validated genes-mass spectral links from the Paired Omics Data Platform, we demonstrate this approach by automatically linking 18 previously known mass spectra (17 for which the biosynthesis gene clusters can be found at the MIBiG database plus palmyramide A) to their corresponding previously experimentally validated biosynthetic genes (e.g., via nuclear magnetic resonance or genetic engineering). We illustrated a computational example of how to use our Natural Products Mixed Omics (NPOmix) tool for siderophore mining that can be reproduced by the users. We conclude that NPOmix minimizes the need for culturing (it worked well on microbiomes) and facilitates specialized metabolite prioritization based on integrative omics mining. © The Author(s) 2022.

Among the plant-parasitic nematodes, the root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.) and root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.) are considered the two most important ones affecting soybeans. In general, they damage soybean roots, causing a reduction of about one-third in productivity. The soil microbial community can exert a suppressive effect on the parasitism of plant-parasitic nematodes. Here, we investigated the effects of soil bacterial diversity on Meloidogyne javanica (Meloidogyne-assay) and Pratylenchus brachyurus (Pratylenchus-assay) suppression by manipulating microbial diversity using the dilution-to-extinction approach in two independent experiments under controlled conditions. Furthermore, we recorded the changes in the soil microbial community induced by plant-parasitic nematode infection. In Meloidogyne-assay, microbial diversity reduced the population density of M. javanica and improved plant performance. In Pratylenchus-assay, microbial diversity sustained the performance of soybean plants even at high levels of P. brachyurus parasitism. Each nematode population affected the relative abundance of different bacterial genera and altered the core microbiome of key groups within the bacterial community. Our findings provide fundamental insights into the interactions between soil bacterial diversity and plant-parasitic nematodes in soybean plants. © 2022 American Society for Microbiology.

Therefore, this work evaluated soil attributes affecting SDZ sorption to several Brazilian soils having contrasting metal (oxy)hydroxide contents. Samples of 23 soils were collected from the upper soil layer (0-20 cm) in the São Paulo State, Brazil, and characterized according to their texture (silt, sand, and clay), pH-H2O, point of zero charge (PZC), organic matter (OM), exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, and Al), potential acidity (H+Al), CEC, well (Fed) and poorly (Feo and Alo) crystallized Fe and Al (oxy)hydroxides, and amorphous Mn oxides (MnO), respectively. Batch sorption studies were performed and related to the soil attributes to group them according with their soil mobility. SDZ sorption coefficients were high (Kd = 15.7–24.0 L kg-1) in soils having high clay (> 500 g kg-1), OM (> 55 g kg-1), and metal (oxy)hydroxide [Fed > 150; Alo > 5; and MnO > 10.0 g kg-1] contents; but they were low (Kd = 0.7–4.9 L kg-1) in soils having low clay (< 250 g kg-1), OM (< 25 g kg-1), and metal (oxy)hydroxide (Fed < 30 and MnO < 2.0 g kg-1) contents. Kd values could be estimated by a regression equation based on CEC as well as Fe and Mn (oxy)hydroxide contents. Acidic tropical soils favor SDZ-neutral species and formation of neutral or positively charged surface sites on pedogenic (oxy)hydroxides that should favor H-bond and surface complexation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the best PS dose that favors the increase in dry matter production and carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) contents and stocks after applications of PS to soils with Tifton-85 for six years. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with four replications, in a hay-producing area under a clayey Typic Hapludox in southern Brazil. The treatments consisted of annual applications of organic and mineral fertilizers at rates based on their N contents, using PS (100, 200, 300, and 400 kg ha−1) and urea (200 kg ha−1), and a control without N application. Samples of the soil in 0–5, 5–10, and 10–30 cm layers were collected in March 2019 and evaluated for soil bulk density and N, C, and S contents and stocks. The Tifton-85 dry matter production was evaluated using samples from three cuts carried out between 2012/2013 and 2017/2018 agricultural years. The applications of increasing doses of PS in Tifton-85 pastures over six years increase linearly the dry matter and soil organic C, N, and S stocks in the 0–30 cm layer. The PS rate equivalent to 100 or 200 kg ha−1 of N is recommended for increasing soil C, N, and S stocks, since it resulted in C, N, and S stocks equal to or higher than the control and mineral (urea) treatments. © 2022 by the authors.

In the agricultural context, several strains of Pantoea spp. can promote plant growth through direct or indirect mechanisms. Members of this genus contribute to plant growth mainly by increasing the supply of nitrogen, solubilizing ammonia and inorganic phosphate, and producing phytohormones (e.g., auxins). Several other studies have shown the potential of strains of Pantoea spp. to induce systemic resistance and protection against pests and pathogenic microorganisms in cultivated plants. Strains of the species Pantoea agglomerans deserve attention as a pest and phytopathogen control agent. Several of them also possess a biotechnological potential for therapeutic purposes (e.g., immunomodulators) and are implicated in human infections. Thus, the differentiation between the harmful and beneficial strains of P. agglomerans is mandatory to apply this bacterium safely as a biofertilizer or biocontroller. This review specifically evaluates the potential of the strain-associated features of P. agglomerans for bioprospecting and agricultural applications through its biological versatility as well as clarifying its potential animal and human health risks from a genomic point of view. © 2022 by the authors.

When Cr is not removed from the tannery sludge, this solid waste is metal-rich and its application could affect the soil microorganisms. Alternatively, the composting of the tannery sludge can contribute to decreasing the concentration of Cr in the composted tannery sludge (CTS). However, in some cases, the concentration of Cr remains high in the CTS. During the last 10 years, the Cr-rich CTS has been successively applied in the soil, and its effect on soil microbial properties was verified. Here, we discuss the effect of successive applications of Cr-rich CTS on soil microbes. Interestingly, the findings have shown that successive applications of Cr-rich CTS selected specific soil microbial groups with potential functions. In addition, the studies added a new focus to further research evaluating the potential effect of successive applications of Cr-rich CTS on the rare microbial community. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The data indicated three mangrove succession phases: 1) an estuarine point bar/tidal flat occupied by a mixture of mangrove species (~2660 - ~ 2050 cal yr BP); 2) a tidal flat dominated by Laguncularia mangroves (~2050 - ~ 900 cal yr BP); and 3) tidal flats with Laguncularia mangroves upstream and establishment of Rhizophora/Avicennia mangrove at the river mouth (~900 cal yr BP until present). The geochemical results suggest a dominance of C3 terrestrial plants with a mixture of C4 plants and organic matter of marine/estuarine origin throughout the late Holocene. Laguncularia and Rhizophora trees were established since ~ 2660 cal yr BP as pioneers, followed thereafter by Avicennia. Currently, tidal flats upstream are occupied by mangroves mainly represented by Laguncularia. Rhizophora/Avicennia mangroves occur at the mouth of the river. The relative sea-level fall during the late Holocene, as well as the channel dynamics, caused the development of tidal flats and mangrove succession inland. The succession of Rhizophora, Laguncularia, and Avicennia, followed by the permanence of only Laguncularia, is likely related to the resilience of each mangrove genus to habitat disturbance (e.g., salinity and sediment grain size fractions) caused by sea-level changes and channel dynamics. Our results show that mangroves may be resilient to the effects of Atlantic sea-level fluctuations, but the floristic structure in the past is different from that of today. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, it has been observed a rich and diverse bacterial community inside nodules. This study assessed the bacterial community in nodule of cowpea grown in sites with distinct soil properties to address the hypothesis that these differences could influence the bacterial community inside the nodules. Soil samples and nodules of cowpea were collected in six different sites from Northeastern, Brazil. There was a different bacterial community structure and composition comparing bulk soil and nodules, with lower diversity in the last. However, the bacterial communities inside the nodules were not different comparing all sites. The bacterial communities found inside the nodules belonged to Proteobacteria (Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium with 97% and 2.63%, respectively), Actinobacteria (Conexibacter and Amycolatopsis with 0.047% and 0.015%, respectively), and Firmicutes (Bacillus and Salipaludibacillus with 0.042% and 0.040%, respectively). Our analysis also showed that bulk soil and nodules presented 99.3% and 0.03% of exclusive OTUs, respectively, while these pools shared 0.4% of the bacterial groups. These results indicate that cowpea selected a specific bacterial group that colonizes the nodules, and it is not influenced by soil properties. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

However, linking community assembly to the ruling ecological processes at local and regional scales remains challenging. Here, we evaluated bacterial community assembly patterns and the ecological processes governing niche specialization in a gradient of geography, seasonality, and land-use change, totaling 324 soil samples, 43 habitat characteristics (abiotic factors), and 16 metabolic and co-occurrence patterns (biotic factors), in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, a subtropical biome recognized as one the world’s largest and most threatened hotspots of biodiversity. Pairwise beta diversities were lower in pastures than in forest and no-till soils. Pasture communities showed a predominantly neutral model, regarding stochastic processes, with moderate dispersion, leading to biotic homogenization. Most no-till and forest microbial communities followed a niche-based model, with low rates of dispersal and weak homogenizing selection, indicating niche specialization or variable selection. Historical and evolutionary contingencies, as represented by soil type, season, and dispersal limitation were the main drivers of microbial assembly and processes at the local scale, markedly correlated with the occurrence of endemic microbes. Our results indicate that the patterns of assembly and their governing processes are dependent on the niche occupancy of the taxa evaluated (generalists or specialists). They are also more correlated with historical and evolutionary contingencies and the interactions among taxa (i.e., co-occurrence patterns) than the land-use change itself. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

To discriminate between ‘special’ and ‘traditional’ classes of green coffee beans, an advanced multispectral imaging technique based on reflectance and autofluorescence data was employed in combination with four machine learning algorithms (SVM, RF, XGBoost, and CatBoost). Of the four algorithms, SVM showed superior accuracy (0.96) for the test dataset. Analysis using PCA and SVM algorithms showed that autofluorescence data from excitation/emission combination of 405/500 nm contributed most to the discrimination of special green coffee from the traditional class. Fluorophores that can be linked to green fluorescence, namely catechin, caffeine and 4-hydroxybenzoic, synapic and chlorogenic acids, were found to have a considerable influence on the differentiation of specialty and traditional coffees. Analysis based on multispectral autofluorescence imaging combined with SVM models was proven to be a valuable tool for future applications in the food industry for the non-destructive and real-time classification of special and traditional green coffee. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we used 16S rRNA sequencing to assess the bacterial community in the rhizosphere of different lines and modern cowpea cultivars, to investigate the effect of cowpea breeding on bacterial community assembly. Thus, two African lines (IT85F-2687 and IT82D-60) and two Brazilian cultivars (BRS-Guariba and BRS-Tumucumaque) of cowpea were assessed to verify if the generation advance and genetic breeding influence the bacterial community in the rhizosphere. No significant differences were found in the structure, richness, and diversity of bacterial community structure between the rhizosphere of the different cowpea genotypes, and only slight differences were found at the OTU level. The complexity of the co-occurrence network decreased from African lines to Brazilian cultivars. Regarding functional prediction, the core functions were significantly altered according to the genotypes. In general, African lines presented a more abundance of groups related to chemoheterotrophy, while the rhizosphere of the modern cultivars decreased functions related to cellulolysis. This study showed that the genetic breeding process affects the dynamics of the rhizosphere community, decreasing the complexity of interaction in one cultivar. As these cowpea genotypes are genetically related, it could suggest a new hypothesis of how genetic breeding of similar genotypes could influence the rhizosphere microbiome. © 2022, The Author(s).

The N management improvement on a farm does not necessarily translate to N pollution reduction on a broader scale due to complex responses of natural and human systems and lack of coordination among stakeholders. Consequently, it is imperative to develop an N management framework that encompasses the complex N dynamics across systems and spatial scales, yet simple enough to guide policies and actions of various stakeholders. Here, we propose a new framework, CAFE, that defines four N management systems (Cropping, Animal-crop, Food, and Ecosystem) in a hierarchical manner, and apply it to 13 representative countries to partition N surpluses across systems in a simple and consistent manner, thereby facilitating the identification and prioritization of systems-based intervention strategies. Surprisingly, the Cropping system contributes less than half of the total N surplus within its Ecosystem for most countries, highlighting the importance of N management beyond croplands. This framework reveals that the relevant priorities and key stakeholders for enhanced N management vary among countries, such as improving the Cropping-system efficiencies in China, adjusting the animal-crop portfolio in the Netherlands, reducing food wastage in the U.S., and lowering crop storage losses and increasing overall production capacities in African countries. As N surplus increases along the CAFE hierarchy, systems-based intervention strategies are revealed: (a) coupling chemical fertilizers with other N sources by maintaining half of the N from manure and biological N fixation; (b) coupling animal-crop production by reducing animal density to lower than 1.2 livestock units per hectare, and increasing self-sufficiency of animal feed to above 50%; (c) coupling food trade with domestic demand and production; and (d) coupling population needs for economic opportunities with environmental capacity of the region. This novel framework can help unpack the “wicked” N management challenges across systems to provide new insights and tools for improving N management on and beyond farms. © 2022 The Authors.

A. psidii is a biotrophic pathogen that reproduces sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction has been previously shown on Syzygium jambos and little is known about its reproductive biology on other hosts or whether populations that were formerly structured by host range can outcross on universally susceptible hosts. We investigated if mating genes in three genomes of A. psidii were under selection as a proxy for whether different strains can reproduce sexually on a shared host. We examined three homologs of the STE3.2 gene, sequences of which were near-identical in the three genomes, and the homeodomain locus, which contained two alleles of two homeodomain genes in each genome. A. psidii likely uses tetrapolar mating. Pheromone/receptor loci were distal to homeodomain loci, and based on haplotypes of a phased assembly, mate compatibility is regulated by multiallelic HD genes and biallelic STE3.2 genes; the third homolog of STE3.2 (STE3.2-1) was present in both haplotypes, and our study supports hypotheses this gene does not regulate mate recognition. Populations of A. psidii formerly structured by host range could potentially outcross on universal hosts based on their related mating genes, however this hypothesis should remain theoretical given the implications for biosecurity. Additionally, we searched for core meiotic genes in genomes of A. psidii, four species of Puccinia, and Sphaerophragmium acaciae through comparative genomics based on 136 meiosis-related orthologous genes modeled from Mycosarcoma maydis. Meiotic genes are conserved in rust fungi at family rank. We analyzed the expression of two meiotic and four mitotic genes of A. psidii on E. grandis over a 28-day time course to validate that identified meiotic genes were upregulated in teliospores. Three mitotic genes were significantly downregulated in samples collected 28 days after inoculation (DAI) compared to 14 DAI. Expression of meiotic genes was significantly up-regulated in samples collected 28 DAI compared to 14 DAI, indicating a temporal switch from production of uredinia (mitotic stage) to telia in the life cycle, which we hypothesize may be in response to leaf ageing. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

However, the influence of soil chemical properties on the dynamics of functional N-genes and losses of N in maize (Zea mays L.) intercropped with forage grasses under N fertilization is poorly understood. In this study, soil samples and N2O emissions were analyzed from a field experiment in which maize (fertilized or not with ammonium-based fertilizer) was intercropped with Guinea grass (M. maximus cv. Tanzânia), palisade grass (U. brizantha cv. Marandu), and ruzigrass (U. ruziziensis cv. Comum). Soil N-cycle microorganisms [16S rRNA of bacteria and archaea, nifH (gene encoding N2-fixing bacteria), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), nirS (encoding nitrite reductase), and nosZ (encoding nitrous oxide reductase)] were influenced by forage grass, N fertilization, and sampling time, but no evidence of biological nitrification inhibition was found. Palisade grass was associated with a higher abundance of nifH (7.0 × 105 gene copies g−1 soil, on average) in the absence of N compared with the other grasses (4.3 × 105 gene copies g−1 soil, on average). Nitrogen fertilization increased the abundance of AOB but not AOA. Furthermore, N2O flux was influenced by AOB, water-filled pore space, and N fertilization, whereas the cumulative N2O emission and fertilizer-induced emission factor (0.36%, on average) were not affected by the grasses. In conclusion, this study reveals the strong dominance of AOB under ammonium supply, potentially stimulating N2O emissions in maize-forage grass intercropping systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

(Fabaceae), cultivars to lepidopterans, including tobacco budworm, Chloridea virescens (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), an important species that causes damage to soybean crops in several production regions. This study was conducted to assess methodologies to determine the optimal combination of larval density, confinement container size, and plant structure in soybean antibiosis assays to C. virescens. In addition, primary and secondary metabolites in plant structures were analyzed to elucidate potential chemical resistance mechanisms against this lepidopteran. Antibiosis assays to C. virescens in resistant (IAC-100) and susceptible (BR-16) soybean cultivars were performed using three larval densities (one, two, and three larvae), two confinement container sizes (150 and 300 ml), and combinations of soybean plant structures (leaves, uncut pods, leaves + uncut pods, cut pods, and leaves + cut pods). Phenol, tannin, fiber, and lignin contents were quantified in the leaves, uncut pods, and grains of the soybean cultivars and related to biological development of C. virescens. Resistance levels in soybean cultivars in antibiosis assays were best differentiated using one larva per 150-ml confinement container, fed only on soybean leaves. Higher contents of condensed tannins in the leaves of IAC-100 cultivar may be one of the main chemical mechanisms of resistance to C. virescens. Our study is the first to determine the optimal combination of larval density, confinement container size, and plant structure for antibiosis assays in soybean cultivars to C. virescens. The developed protocol will benefit high-throughput phenotyping in genetic breeding programs to obtain cultivars resistant to lepidopterans for use in integrated pest management. © 2022 Netherlands Entomological Society.

This data article included the analysis of 18 chemical variables in 36 composite samples (included 4 replicates) of soils from the Microregion of Garanhuns (Northeast Brazil) and also partial 16S rRNA gene sequences from genomic DNA extracted from 27 of these samples (included 3 best quality replicates) for paired-end sequencing (up to 2 × 300 bp) in Illumina MiSeq platform (NCBI - BioProject accession: PRJNA753707). Soils were collected in August 2018 in a tropical subhumid region from the Brazilian Caatinga, along with 27 composite samples from the aboveground part of pastures to determine nutritional quality based on leaf N content. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc tests of environmental data and the main alpha-diversity indices based on linear mixed models (LMM) were represented in the tables. In this case, the collection region (C1 – Brejão, C2 – Garanhuns, and C3 – São João) was the random-effect variable and adjacent habitats formed by a forest (FO) and two pastures (PA and PB succeeded by this forest) composed the fixed-effect variable (land cover), both nested within C. In addition, a table with similarity percentages breakdown (SIMPER) was also shown, a procedure to assess the average percent contribution of individual phyla and bacterial classes. The figures showed the details of the study location, sampling procedure, vegetation status through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in addition to the general abundance and composition of the main bacterial phyla. © 2022	Data paper	Scopus

They grow fast on water’s surface and produce large amounts of biomass. Further, duckweeds display high adaptability, and species are found around the globe growing under different environmental conditions. In this work, we report the composition of 21 ecotypes of fourteen species of duckweeds belonging to the two subfamilies of the group (Lemnoideae and Wolffioideae). It is reported the presence of starch and the composition of soluble sugars, cell walls, amino acids, phenolics, and tannins. These data were combined with literature data recovered from 85 publications to produce a compiled analysis that affords the examination of duckweeds as possible food sources for human consumption. We compare duckweeds compositions with some of the most common food sources and conclude that duckweed, which is already in use as food in Asia, can be an interesting food source anywhere in the world. © 2022 by the authors.

The plant bears button-shaped extrafloral nectaries exclusively in adult leaves. Extrafloral nectaries are structures that secrete nectar and play an important role in plant–animal interactions as a strategy for protecting plants against herbivory. In this work, we performed anatomical and ultrastructural studies to characterize P. organensis extrafloral nectaries during their secretory phase. We showed extrafloral nectaries in Passiflora organensis are composed of three distinct regions: nectary epidermis, nectariferous parenchyma, and subnectariferous parenchyma. Our data suggests that all nectary regions constitute a functional unit involved in nectar production and release. The high metabolic activity in the nectary cells is characterized by the juxtaposition of organelles such as mitochondria and plastids together plasmalemma. In addition, calcium oxalate crystals are frequently associated to the nectaries. An increasing concentration of calcium during leaf development and nectary differentiation was observed, corresponding to the calcium deposition as calcium oxalate crystals. This is the first description of extrafloral nectaries in Passiflora organensis that is a promising tropical model species for several studies. Research Highlights: The anatomical and ultrastructural characteristics and the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the nectary tissue suggest novel strategies against herbivory in the genus Passiflora. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The appropriate quantification of GHG emissions, specifically methane (CH4), has raised questions about the correct reporting of GHG inventories and, perhaps more importantly, how best to mitigate CH4 emissions. This review documents existing methods and methodologies to measure and estimate CH4 emissions from ruminant animals and the manure produced therein over various scales and conditions. Measurements of CH4 have frequently been conducted in research settings using classical methodologies developed for bioenergetic purposes, such as gas exchange techniques (respiration chambers, headboxes). While very precise, these techniques are limited to research settings as they are expensive, labor-intensive, and applicable only to a few animals. Head-stalls, such as the GreenFeed system, have been used to measure expired CH4 for individual animals housed alone or in groups in confinement or grazing. This technique requires frequent animal visitation over the diurnal measurement period and an adequate number of collection days. The tracer gas technique can be used to measure CH4 from individual animals housed outdoors, as there is a need to ensure low background concentrations. Micrometeorological techniques (e.g., open-path lasers) can measure CH4 emissions over larger areas and many animals, but limitations exist, including the need to measure over more extended periods. Measurement of CH4 emissions from manure depends on the type of storage, animal housing, CH4 concentration inside and outside the boundaries of the area of interest, and ventilation rate, which is likely the variable that contributes the greatest to measurement uncertainty. For large-scale areas, aircraft, drones, and satellites have been used in association with the tracer flux method, inverse modeling, imagery, and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), but research is lagging in validating these methods. Bottom-up approaches to estimating CH4 emissions rely on empirical or mechanistic modeling to quantify the contribution of individual sources (enteric and manure). In contrast, top-down approaches estimate the amount of CH4 in the atmosphere using spatial and temporal models to account for transportation from an emitter to an observation point. While these two estimation approaches rarely agree, they help identify knowledge gaps and research requirements in practice.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Breeds included Bos taurus ibericus (Crioulo Lageano, Curraleiro Pé Duro, Junqueira, Pantaneiro), Bos taurus ibericus x Bos taurus aquitanicus (Mocho Nacional) and Bos taurus indicus (Indubrasil) totaling 548 observations. The statistical analyses carried out were path analysis and logistic regression using SAS software to determine the relationship between the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) and physiological parameters for the different breeds. Path analysis showed the relationship between environmental conditions and physiological variables such as respiratory rate, heart rate, blood parameters and rectal temperature, as well as morphological traits. Logistic regression analysis showed that the Mocho Nacional breed presented an increased respiratory rate before the other breeds, and Junqueira was the last breed. The change in rectal temperature occurred first in the Pantaneiro breed and last in the Indubrasil breed. The use of path analysis and logistic regression allows a better comprehension of how the animal organism's responses in each breed to environmental alterations that lead to heat stress. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Stable isotope ratios are helpful in animal ecology for several reasons; for instance, they can be used to investigate trophic niches, energy sources (diet tracing) and to track migration patterns. The Neotropics are considered one of the most undersampled regions of the world. Given that Brazil is a continental country where most of the dietary ecology of animal species is under-assessed, we believe that the SIA-BRA can provide important complementary information to address this gap in the literature. Additionally, the SIA-BRA data set allows future investigations to address many questions concerning diet tracing, habitat use, food webs, foraging ecology, physiological aspects and effects of phylogeny on dietary ecology. Main type of variable investigated: Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios for terrestrial and aquatic animals. Spatial location and grain: The SIA-BRA included animal tissues sampled in 964 sites in the main Brazilian biomes and coastal marine areas. Time period: The data represent information published and/or sampled from 1984 to 2021. Major taxa studied and measurement level: The SIA-BRA contains isotopic data of c. 21,804 non-captive wildlife specimens, excluding livestock production or laboratory experiments. They were 13,881 vertebrates and 7,923 invertebrates. They were divided into the following habitats: terrestrial (30% of the total), freshwater (27%), oceanic (40%) and estuarine (4%). There were 11 phyla, with a clear dominance of Chordata (64%) and Arthropoda (29%), 36 classes, 154 orders, 473 families, 894 genera and 1,157 species.

The δDwax record indicates drier conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and a transition to wetter conditions into the Holocene, while the δ13Cwax data reveal that vegetation did not experienced C3/C4 shifts and remained dominated by C3-plant communities. Under glacial conditions C3-savanna was prominent on the Serra Sul plateau with tropical forest areas limited to the lower slopes. Tropical forests expanded upslope and forest patches developed on the plateau as a response to more humid and warmer conditions during the Holocene. Pollen data indicate a shift towards more open landscape of savanna, woodlands, and open forests during the mid-Holocene. The δDwax record exhibits a distinct moisture variability during the Holocene, not always coherent with the vegetation data (pollen), especially during the mid-Holocene interval. Our study confirms the complexity and the overall lack of coherence among Holocene moisture proxy records throughout the monsoon domain in South America and suggest that Holocene local moisture conditions might not follow the regional monsoonal variability. Our data further stress the need for more multi-proxy reconstructions of hydroclimate patterns in SE Amazonia. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

The major mechanisms that allow plants to cope with Al involve manipulations of organic acids metabolism and DNA-checkpoints. When assumed individually both approaches have been insufficient to overcome Al toxicity. On analysing the centre of origin of most cultivated plants, we hypothesised that day-length seems to be a pivotal agent modulating Al tolerance across distinct plant species. We observed that with increasing distance from the Equator, Al tolerance decreases, suggesting a relationship with the photoperiod. We verified that long-day (LD) species are generally more Al-sensitive than short-day (SD) species, whereas genetic conversion of tomato for SD growth habit boosts Al tolerance. Reduced Al tolerance correlates with DNA-checkpoint activation under LD. Furthermore, DNA-checkpoint-related genes are under positive selection in Arabidopsis accessions from regions with shorter days, suggesting that photoperiod act as a selective barrier for Al tolerance. A diel regulation and genetic diversity affect Al tolerance, suggesting that day-length orchestrates Al tolerance. Altogether, photoperiodic control of Al tolerance might contribute to solving the historical obstacle that imposes barriers for developing countries to reach a sustainable agriculture. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The sustainability of tree plantations can be inferred from their ecological strategies along the fast-slow economic spectrum. Abstract: Growing plantations with native trees is crucial for ecosystem restoration and wood and non-wood product supply, but silvicultural guidelines are lacking. The growth, survival, biomass allocation, nutrient accumulation and nutrient use efficiency, 13C isotopic composition, canopy openness, and solar radiation in understory and grass cover were assessed in monoculture plantations of fast [Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum (Huber & Ducke) Barneby], and slow [Anadenanthera peregrina var. peregrina (L.) Speg.] growing species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Nine experimental plots per species and a stand density of 1111 trees ha−1 were examined 6 years after planting. The mean values of wood density were higher in A. peregrina than S. parahyba trees, with 0.66 g cm−3 and 0.27 g cm−3, respectively. S. parahyba trees showed 75% higher stem-wood biomass, with five times less leaf biomass than A. peregrina trees. However, contrasting diameter growth and survival rates resulted in comparable stand above-ground biomass between species. Macronutrient content and δ13C composition differences showed that S. parahyba exhibits higher nutrient use while A. peregrina has higher intrinsic water efficiency. Grass was abundant in the S. parahyba plantations and suppressed in the A. peregrina plantations, in line with the observed canopy openness and solar radiation in the understory. Functional traits allow the prediction of the contrasting silvicultural potentials of A. peregrina (wood production and microclimate recovery) and S. parahyba (timber production and agroforestry). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Conversely, domesticated tomatoes (S. lycopersicum) lack type-IV trichomes on the leaves of mature plants, preventing high AS production, thus rendering the plants more vulnerable to insect predation. We hypothesized that cultivated tomatoes engineered to harbor type-IV trichomes on the leaves of adult plants could be insect-resistant. We introgressed the genetic determinants controlling type-IV trichome development from S. galapagense into cv. Micro-Tom (MT) and created a line named “Galapagos-enhanced trichomes” (MT-Get). Mapping-by-sequencing revealed that five chromosomal regions of S. galapagense were present in MT-Get. Further genetic mapping showed that S. galapagense alleles in chromosomes 1, 2, and 3 were sufficient for the presence of type-IV trichomes on adult organs but at lower densities. Metabolic and gene expression analyses demonstrated that type-IV trichome density was not accompanied by the AS production and exudation in MT-Get. Although the plants produce a significant amount of acylsugars, those are still not enough to make them resistant to whiteflies. We demonstrate that type-IV glandular trichome development is insufficient for high AS accumulation. The results from our study provided additional insights into the steps necessary for breeding an insect-resistant tomato. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	Article	Scopus

In this paper, we present, in high-resolution, the stratigraphy and morphological, physical, chemical, elemental, and isotopic properties of a deep soil vereda core (Pau Grande, with 283 cm) from the Grande Sertão Veredas National Park, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The core is constituted by 10 histic horizons in the first 151 cm, and one mineral layer from 151 to 283 cm. Peat sedimentation rates were different along its depth, as follow: 0.0273 cm year−1 (109–111 cm), 0.0018 cm year−1 (85–87 cm), 0.0027 cm year−1 (59–61 cm), 0.0031 cm year−1 (45–47 cm), and 0.0042 cm year−1 (24–26 cm). Mean values of the main peat properties were: 16% for C, 44% for Si, −17.20‰ for δ13C, 3.68‰ for δ15N, 167% for gravimetric moisture, 75% for mineral material, 8% for rubbed fibres, 3.58 for pH, 0.77 Mg m−3 for bulk density, and 0.15 for bulk density of the organic matter. Principal components analysis was applied to peat properties to assist in the identification of processes/drivers that control the nature of the studied vereda, in addition to providing evidence of changes in the paleoenvironment. The first principal component, PC1, is related to the relative accumulation of organic versus local mineral matter, linked to the evolution of the catchment soils (erosion) and possible associated vegetation (C3 and C4 plants); PC2 is related to the hydromorphism conditions; PC3 is related to the incorporation of inorganic material through the deposition of dust from regional sources; and PC4 is related to the main sources of organic matter. Radiocarbon dating indicates this vereda began its formation during the late Pleistocene. Five phases of changes in the environment were also verified: I) 33,309–26,818 cal BP – formation of a lake or a shallow water body, predominance of algae, and locally and regionally unstable environment; II) 26,818–16,659 cal BP – predominance of terrestrial plants, locally stable but regionally unstable environment; III) 16,659–10,401 cal BP – oxic, drier environment with a predominance of C4 terrestrial plants, and a simultaneous increase in local instability with stabilization of the regional environment at ∼ 15.0 kyr cal BP; IV) 10,401–5,052 cal BP – return to being an algal source in even more oxic conditions, and beginning of greater stability in both the local and regional environments; and V) 5,052 cal BP until present – consolidation of the stable environment initiated in the previous phase, characteristic reducing environment to that currently found in the Pau Grande vereda, and changing the contribution of organic matter sources, initially with terrestrial plants and, subsequently, algae. Our results suggest that the Pau Grande vereda is a complex ecosystem. These environments have a large potential for studies on environmental reconstruction and climate changes that have occurred since the late Pleistocene, and they should be fully protected. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This biome is characterised by high irradiance and limited water conditions. Unlike other resurrection plants, B. graminifolia can maintain a high hydric status (>80%) after 28 days of water suppression before desiccation. We investigated the physiological and metabolic mechanisms associated with structural changes that allow B. graminifolia to maintain hydration under a prolonged water deficit and to recover after desiccation. After 30 days of water deficit, desiccated plants exhibited chlorophyll degradation, a 178.4% and 193.7% increase in total carotenoids and MDA, respectively, and twice the CAT and APX activity compared to hydrated plants. The metabolite profile showed increased amino acids, carbohydrates, saturated fatty acids and benzoic acids during dehydration, while trichloroacetic acid cycle acids were higher in hydrated and rehydrated plants. Anatomical and ultrastructural data corroborated the physiological and metabolic changes and revealed the presence of mucilaginous cells with high water retention capacity. Our data indicated that combined strategies of assimilatory metabolism shutdown, accumulation of compatible solutes and antioxidant compounds, increase in hydrophilic molecules, changes in the composition of membrane lipids and remodelling of cell organelles conditioned the efficiency of B. graminifolia in delaying water loss, tolerating further desiccation and quickly recovering after rehydration. These attributes evidence that this species is well adapted to cope with adverse environmental conditions, mainly directing the metabolism to an efficient antioxidant response and improving its capacity to retain water during the dry season. © 2022 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society.

Berg) Landrum (Myrtaceae), known as cambuci, is a native species from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest with great potential to be developed as a new fruit crop. Microsatellite markers were developed for cambuci to characterize the genetic diversity and to investigate the genetic structure of a group of accessions originally collected at the presumed center of the species diversity. This work involved the collection of 145 accessions from five regional groups (Juquitiba, Paraibuna, Mogi das Cruzes, Ribeirão Pires, and Salesópolis) in São Paulo state, Brazil. Fourteen loci were identified in an enriched genomic library developed from one of these accessions. Six of the 14 loci were polymorphic, disclosing 26 alleles. Based on the allele frequencies, the calculated genetic parameters of the five groups indicated an average allele number per locus (A) of 3.83, with an expected heterozygosity (He) of 0.57 and observed heterozygosity (Ho) of 0.54. Analysis of the genetic structure indicated that most of the genetic diversity was found within population (HS = 0.57), whereas the genetic diversity among populations was low (GST = 0.19). The genetic diversity parameter of Nei was considered low for the cambuci analyzed populations, with no evidence of inbreeding. Based on Darwin analysis, 18 accessions were chosen from the five regional populations to compose a core collection that included most of the genetic diversity found in this study. Our findings may contribute to defining better conservation strategies and genetic breeding approaches for this native species in Brazil. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

Plant AMTs can be categorized into AMT1 and AMT2 subfamilies. Functional studies of AMTs, particularly AMT1-type, have been conducted using model plants but little is known about the function of AMTs from crops. Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is a major bioenergy crop that requires heavy nitrogen fertilization but depends on a low carbon-footprint for competitive sustainability. Here, we identified and functionally characterized sugarcane ScAMT2;1 by complementing ammonium uptake-defective mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana. Reporter gene driven by the ScAMT2;1 promoter in A. thaliana revealed preferential expression in the shoot vasculature and root endodermis/pericycle according to nitrogen availability and source. Arabidopsis quadruple mutant plants expressing ScAMT2;1 driven by the CaMV35S promoter or by a sugarcane endogenous promoter produced significantly more biomass than mutant plants when grown in NH4+ and showed more 15N-ammonium uptake by roots and nitrogen translocation to shoots. In A. thaliana, ScAMT2;1 displayed a Km of 90.17 µM and Vmax of 338.99 µmoles h-1 g-1 root DW. Altogether, our results suggest that ScAMT2;1 is a functional high-affinity ammonium transporter that might contribute to ammonium uptake and presumably to root-to-shoot translocation under high NH4+ conditions.

The application of XRF and LIBS sensors in an individual or combined manner for soil fertility prediction is quite recent, especially in tropical soils. The shared dataset presents spectral data of VNIR, XRF, and LIBS sensors, even as the characterization of key soil fertility attributes (clay, organic matter, cation exchange capacity, pH, base saturation, and exchangeable P, K, Ca, and Mg) of 102 soil samples. The samples were obtained from two Brazilian agricultural areas and have a wide variation of chemical and textural attributes. This is a pioneer dataset of tropical soils, with potential to be reused for comparative studies with other datasets, e.g., comparing the performance of sensors, instrumental conditions, and/or predictive models on different soil types, soil origin, concentration range, and agricultural practices. Moreover, it can also be applied to compose soil spectral libraries that use spectral data collected under similar instrumental conditions. © 2022	Data paper	Scopus

This condition induces an imbalance of the carbon (C): nitrogen (N): phosphorus (P) stoichiometric homeostasis, impairing accumulated nutrients from being converted into biomass. Silicon (Si) supplementation can mitigate the damage caused by water deficit in plants by improving the C:N:P balance, increasing C, N, and P use efficiencies and the biomass conversion, and reducing climate change effects on crops. This study assesses the beneficial effects of Si applied through fertigation associated with foliar spraying on the alleviation of damage caused by severe water deficit in sugarcane and energy cane for intermediate and long periods. In addition, the effects in maintenance of nutritional homeostasis we assessed and C, N, and P use efficiencies on sugarcane and energy cane under those conditions were increased. Four experiments were conducted during the first growth cycle of each species. The effect of fertigation associated with Si foliar spraying was evaluated by applying Si only during the seedling formation phase in sugarcane and energy cane grown under severe water deficit for 60 days after transplanting (intermediate period). Then, the effect of Si applied during seedling formation and supplemented after transplanting was evaluated in sugarcane and energy cane grown under severe water deficit for 160 days after transplanting (long period). The Si supply decreased C contents, modified the C:N:P ratio, and increased C, N, and P use efficiencies in plants of both species under water deficit at the intermediate and long periods after transplanting. The effects of applying Si through fertigation associated with foliar spraying during seedling formation mitigated the damage caused by severe water deficit in the intermediate period, which was mainly observed in sugarcane. When supplemented with Si after transplanting, the mitigating effects occurred in both species under severe long period water deficit. Therefore, the Si supply through fertigation associated with foliar spraying is a viable alternative to provide Si to the plant. It also comes with beneficial effects that partially reverse the damage to nutritional homeostasis and increase nutritional efficiency in plants under severe water deficit.

In this scenario, the use of enzyme products in ruminant nutrition may be an important alternative to meet future increased demands for animal products with reduced environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of treating forage with a fibrolytic enzymes extract (FEE), produced by Trichoderma reesei, on animal performance, blood biochemical parameters, nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation, and enteric CH4 production of growing lambs. Nineteen Santa Inês growing lambs were divided into two groups: control (CTL) and enzyme (ENZ). The animals were fed with 700 g/kg of tifton-85 hay and 300 g/kg (as fed basis) of concentrate mixture for 73 days. The FEE was manually applied 24 h before each feed supply. Initially, animals were kept in individual pens for the growth performance trial (15 days of adaptation plus 45 for data collection), then were taken to metabolic cages (seven days) and to gas measurement chambers (six days) for the metabolism assay and determination of CH4 production, respectively. No effects (P > 0.05) were observed on dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), and feed conversion ratio. However, ENZ animals showed higher proportion of body weight gain (PBWG) when considering the entire growth performance period (P < 0.05). Analysis of blood parameters indicated that FEE did not impair animals’ health. Lambs fed forages treated with FEE showed 12% higher acid detergent fiber (ADF) digestibility (P < 0.05) and 20% lower enteric CH4 yield (i.e. per kg of digestible organic matter intake) (P < 0.05). Microbial protein synthesis, pH, ammonia nitrogen, short-chain fatty acids concentration and protozoa population were not affected by the addition of FEE (P > 0.05). The results indicated that FEE can be used in diets of lambs, leading to higher PBWG, improving ADF digestibility and reducing CH4 yield, suggesting its potential suitability as a strategy to increase animal productivity and contribute to the mitigation of enteric CH4 production, especially when animals are fed poor-quality forages. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, one can expect the increasing discharge of nanoparticles closer to water streams in the near future. In this study, we employed the model fresh water organism Daphnia magna to investigate the uptake, acute toxicity and depuration of ZnO nanoparticles. The present study shows that the median lethal concentration (LC50) depended on particle size and the presence of surfactant. The LC50 for positive control ZnSO4 (2.15 mg L−1), 20 nm ZnO (1.68 mg L−1), and 40 nm ZnO (1.71 mg L−1) were statistically the same. However, the addition of surfactant increased the LC50 of 40 nm and 60 nm to 2.93 and 3.24 mg L−1, respectively. The 300 nm ZnO was the least toxic nanoparticle presenting LC50 of 6.35 mg L−1. X-ray fluorescence chemical imaging revealed that Zn accumulated along the digestive system regardless the particle size. Finally, contrary to what have been reported by several papers, the present study did not detect any depuration of ZnO nanoparticles in the next 24 h past the exposure assays.

Most research has focused on the impacts of climatic water availability, whereas remarkably little is known about the influence of water table depth and excess soil water on forest processes. Nevertheless, given that plants take up water from the soil, the impacts of climatic water supply on plants are likely to be modulated by soil water conditions. Location: Lowland Amazonian forests. Time period: 1971–2019. Methods: We used 344 long-term inventory plots distributed across Amazonia to analyse the effects of long-term climatic and edaphic water supply on forest functioning. We modelled forest structure and dynamics as a function of climatic, soil-water and edaphic properties. Results: Water supplied by both precipitation and groundwater affects forest structure and dynamics, but in different ways. Forests with a shallow water table (depth <5 m) had 18% less above-ground woody productivity and 23% less biomass stock than forests with a deep water table. Forests in drier climates (maximum cumulative water deficit < −160 mm) had 21% less productivity and 24% less biomass than those in wetter climates. Productivity was affected by the interaction between climatic water deficit and water table depth. On average, in drier climates the forests with a shallow water table had lower productivity than those with a deep water table, with this difference decreasing within wet climates, where lower productivity was confined to a very shallow water table. Main conclusions: We show that the two extremes of water availability (excess and deficit) both reduce productivity in Amazon upland (terra-firme) forests. Biomass and productivity across Amazonia respond not simply to regional climate, but rather to its interaction with water table conditions, exhibiting high local differentiation. Our study disentangles the relative contribution of those factors, helping to improve understanding of the functioning of tropical ecosystems and how they are likely to respond to climate change. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

In the Amazonian floodplains, soils are subjected to extended seasons of flooding during the rainy season, in which they can become anoxic and produce a significant amount of methane (CH4). Various microorganisms in this anoxic environment can couple the reduction of different ions, such as NO2– and NO3–, with the oxidation of CH4 for energy production and effectively link the carbon and nitrogen cycle. Here, we addressed the composition of ammonium (NH4+) and NO3–—and NO2–—dependent CH4-oxidizing microbial communities in an Amazonian floodplain. In addition, we analyzed the influence of environmental and geochemical factors on these microbial communities. Soil samples were collected from different layers of forest and agroforest land-use systems during the flood and non-flood seasons in the floodplain of the Tocantins River, and next-generation sequencing of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons was performed, coupled with chemical characterization of the soils. We found that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were more abundant than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) during both flood and non-flood seasons. Nitrogen-dependent anaerobic methane oxidizers (N-DAMO) from both the archaeal and bacterial domains were also found in both seasons, with higher abundance in the flood season. The different seasons, land uses, and depths analyzed had a significant influence on the soil chemical factors and also affected the abundance and composition of AOA, AOB, and N-DAMO. During the flood season, there was a significant correlation between ammonia oxidizers and N-DAMO, indicating the possible role of these oxidizers in providing oxidized nitrogen species for methanotrophy under anaerobic conditions, which is essential for nitrogen removal in these soils.

The vertical range of the vermetid bioconstructions and, consequently, their precision as a sea-level indicator, varies from ±0.1 to ±1.0 m according to local conditions such as wave energy exposure and tidal range. However, live vermetid bioconstructions are scarce or do not occur at several places south of 23°S latitude, which has led to the use of other bioconstructions (e.g. Phragmatopoma caudata) as a homologous reference level, adding uncertainties to the paleo-sea level reconstructions. At the Southeast Brazilian coast, from 25° 30′ S to 28° 37′ S latitude, the precision varies from ±0.5 to ±1.0 m. At the Ponta do Papagaio headland, at 27°50′38″- 44″ S latitude, the occurrence of the subfossil barnacle Tetraclita stalactifera included in the remains of Holocene vermetids (Petaloconchus varians (d'Orbigny, 1839)) bioconstructions allowed the authors to adopt the living fringe of this barnacle species as a homologous reference level and thereby improve the accuracy of paleo-sea level reconstructions (error margin of only ± 0.5 to ± 0.3 m). The paleo-sea level obtained at Ponta do Papagaio by this method varied between +2.4 and 0.8 m. The resultant relative sea-level curve is included in the empiric sea-level envelop previously determined for the Brazilian coast, south of 28°S latitude, and matches with the far-field eustatic sea-level models. It is also similar to other curves defined for Southern Brazil regions such as Laguna-Imbituba (Santa Marta Cape surroundings, 85-40 km to South from Ponta do Papagaio), São Francisco do Sul (180 km North) and Paraná (220–260 km North). However, the height of 2.4 ± 0.3 m at 4 ky BP at Ponta do Papagaio is similar to the two cited regions to the North, but higher than the one at Laguna-Imbituba for the same period. This difference may not be significant, as it is within the ±1.0 m error margin adopted in the inference of the paleo-sea level at Laguna-Imbituba. If it is significant, it can be attributed to a local lowering of relative sea-level by thermosteric and dynamic effects of the Santa Marta Cape coastal upwelling strengthening at the epoch of maximum sea-level. This work also suggests further quantification of the living vertical distribution of vermetids and other species used as reference species (e.g. Tetraclita stalactifera, Phragmatopoma caudata), under different bedrock morphology, wave exposure and oceanographic conditions, as a necessary way to improve the precision of paleo-sea level reconstructions. © 2022	Article	Scopus

Abstract: Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is one of the most suitable energy crops for biofuel feedstock, but the reduced recovery of nitrogen (N) fertilizer by sugarcane roots increases the crop carbon footprint. The low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of sugarcane has been associated with the significantly low nitrate uptake, which limits the utilization of the large amount of nitrate available in agricultural soils. To understand the regulation of nitrate uptake in sugarcane roots, we identified the major canonical nitrate transporter genes (NRTs—NITRATE TRANSPORTERS) and then determined their expression profiles in roots under contrasting N conditions. Correlation of gene expression with 15N-nitrate uptake revealed that under N deprivation or inorganic N (ammonium or nitrate) supply in N-sufficient roots, the regulation of ScNRT2.1 and ScNRT3.1 expression is the predominant mechanism for the modulation of the activity of the nitrate high-affinity transport system. Conversely, in N-deficient roots, the induction of ScNRT2.1 and ScNRT3.1 transcription is not correlated with the marked repression of nitrate uptake in response to nitrate resupply or high N provision, which suggested the existence of a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism. Our findings suggested that high-affinity nitrate uptake is regulated at the transcriptional and presumably at the posttranscriptional levels based on the physiological N status and that the regulation of NRT2.1 and NRT3.1 activity is likely a determinant mechanism for the discrimination against nitrate uptake observed in sugarcane roots, which contributes to the low NUE in this crop species. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The steps inherent to both liquid-liquid extraction and monitoring of the formed compound are in-syringe carried out. The classical carbon tetrachloride is not used as the extracting solvent, as it does not present the friendly characteristics inherent to the Green Analytical Chemistry. Aiming at a cleaner alternative for this determination, xylene is selected. Enrichment factor, linear dynamic range, detection limit, sample throughput and residue volume inherent to the proposed procedure were estimated as 36, 50.0–250 μg L−1, 9.0 μg L−1, 13 h−1, and 2.0 mL, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated the significance of changes in auxin signalling during different stages of fruit development by analysing changes in tomato fruit quality and primary metabolism using mutants with either lower or higher auxin sensitivity [diageotropica (dgt) and entire mutants, respectively]. Altered auxin sensitivity modifies metabolism, through direct impacts on fruit respiration and fruit growth. We verified that the dgt mutant plants exhibit reductions in fruit set, total fruit dry weight, fruit size, number of seeds per fruit, and fresh weight loss during post-harvest. Sugar accumulation was associated with delayed fruit ripening in dgt, probably connected with reduced ethylene levels and respiration, coupled with a lower rate of starch degradation. In contrast, despite exhibiting parthenocarpy, increased auxin perception (entire) did not alter fruit ripening, leading to only minor changes in primary metabolism. By performing a comprehensive analysis, our results connect auxin signalling and metabolic changes during tomato fruit development, indicating that reduced auxin signalling led to extensive changes in sugar concentration and starch metabolism during tomato fruit ripening.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

However, it remains unclear if these climate feedbacks can amplify land-use-related impacts on the CH4 cycle. To better predict the responses of soil CH4-cycling microorganisms and emissions under altered moisture levels in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon, we performed a 30-day microcosm experiment manipulating the moisture content (original moisture; 60%, 80%, and 100% of field capacity - FC) of forest and pasture soils. Gas samples were collected periodically for gas chromatography analysis, and methanogenic archaeal and methanotrophic bacterial communities were assessed using quantitative PCR and metagenomics. Positive and negative daily CH4 fluxes were observed for forest and pasture, indicating that these soils can act as both CH4 sources and sinks. Cumulative emissions and the abundance of methanogenesis-related genes and taxonomic groups were affected by land use, moisture, and their interaction. Pasture soils at 100% FC had the highest abundance of methanogens and CH4 emissions, 22 times higher than forest soils under the same treatment. Higher ratios of methanogens to methanotrophs were found in pasture than in forest soils, even at field capacity conditions. Land use and moisture were significant factors influencing the composition of methanogenic and methanotrophic communities. The diversity and evenness of methanogens did not change throughout the experiment. In contrast, methanotrophs exhibited the highest diversity and evenness in pasture soils at 100% FC. Taken together, our results suggest that increased moisture exacerbates soil CH4 emissions and microbial responses driven by land-use change in the Amazon. This is the first report on the microbial CH4 cycle in Amazonian upland soils that combined one-month gas measurements with advanced molecular methods. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.	Article	Scopus

When leaf age is taken into account, it is generally considered discontinuous, and leaves are classified into age categories based on qualitative observations. Here, we quantified age-dependent changes in leaf functional traits such as the maximum carboxylation rate of ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (Vcmax), stomatal control (Cgs%), leaf dry mass per area and leaf macronutrient concentrations for nine naturally growing Amazon tropical trees with variable phenological strategies. Leaf ages were assessed by monthly censuses of branch-level leaf demography; we also performed leaf trait measurements accounting for leaf chronological age based on days elapsed since the first inclusion in the leaf demography, not predetermined age classes. At the tree community scale, a nonlinear relationship between Vcmax and leaf age existed: young, developing leaves showed the lowest mean photosynthetic capacity, increasing to a maximum at 45 days and then decreasing gradually with age in both continuous and categorical age group analyses. Maturation times among species and phenological habits differed substantially, from 8 ± 30 to 238 ± 30 days, and the rate of decline of Vcmax varied from -0.003 to -0.065 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1 day-1. Stomatal control increased significantly in young leaves but remained constant after peaking. Mass-based phosphorus and potassium concentrations displayed negative relationships with leaf age, whereas nitrogen did not vary temporally. Differences in life strategies, leaf nutrient concentrations and phenological types, not the leaf age effect alone, may thus be important factors for understanding observed photosynthesis seasonality in Amazonian forests. Furthermore, assigning leaf age categories in diverse tree communities may not be the recommended method for studying carbon uptake seasonality in the Amazon, since the relationship between Vcmax and leaf age could not be confirmed for all trees. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Robust pattern-recognition methods, such as deep learning, can achieve higher precision in detecting infected seeds using more accessible solutions, such as ordinary RGB cameras. This study used different deep-learning approaches based on RGB images, combining hyperparameter optimization, and fine-tuning strategies with different pretrained convolutional neural networks (convnets) to discriminate wheat seeds of the TBIO Toruk cultivar infected by FHB. The models achieved an accuracy of 97% using a low-complexity design architecture with hyperparameter optimization and 99% accuracy in detecting FHB in seeds. These findings suggest the potential of low-cost imaging technology and deep-learning models for the accurate classification of wheat seeds infected by FHB. However, FHB symptoms are genotype-dependent, and therefore the accuracy of the detection method may vary depending on phenotypic variations among wheat cultivars. © 2022 by the authors.

This pesticide has been found in freshwater ecosystems, including Brazilian freshwaters. For this reason, studies are being conducted to detect the presence of IMI in freshwater and understand its effects on the aquatic biota. In the present study, the acute toxic effect of the imidacloprid commercial formulation (ICF) Galeão® on the Brazilian non-target aquatic organisms Chironomus sancticaroli and Poecilia reticulata was evaluated. Enzymatic activities (glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX)) were also determined. Moreover, we considered 11 studies that detected IMI concentrations up to 3.65 µg.L−1 in 28 different Brazilian freshwaters to evaluate the acute ecological risk of IMI in these environments. From the ecotoxicological assays, we determined the LC50 values for C. sancticaroli (LC50-48 h 1.52 µg.L−1) and P. reticulata (LC50-96 h 122.65 mg.L−1). The high sensitivity of C. sancticaroli demonstrates that this species could be used as a bioindicator in studies investigating the contamination of freshwater by IMI. Enzymatic activity changes were observed in both organisms and offered sublethal responses to the effects of the pollution by IMI on aquatic biota. Our results suggest that the presence of IMI in Brazilian aquatic ecosystems can represent a potential ecological risk for the aquatic insect populations and, consequently, cause an imbalance in these ecosystems. The present study provides relevant and comparable toxicity information that may be useful to develop public policies to protect the Brazilian aquatic ecosystem from IMI contamination. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Decreasing the emissions of enteric CH4 from ruminant production is strategic to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5°C by 2050. Research in the area of enteric CH4 mitigation has grown exponentially in the last 2 decades, with various strategies for enteric CH4 abatement being investigated: production intensification, dietary manipulation (including supplementation and processing of concentrates and lipids, and management of forage and pastures), rumen manipulation (supplementation of ionophores, 3-nitrooxypropanol, macroalgae, alternative electron acceptors, and phytochemicals), and selection of low-CH4-producing animals. Other enteric CH4 mitigation strategies are at earlier stages of research but rapidly developing. Herein, we discuss and analyze the current status of available enteric CH4 mitigation strategies with an emphasis on opportunities and barriers to their implementation in confined and partial grazing production systems, and in extensive and fully grazing production systems. For each enteric CH4 mitigation strategy, we discuss its effectiveness to decrease total CH4 emissions and emissions on a per animal product basis, safety issues, impacts on the emissions of other greenhouse gases, as well as other economic, regulatory, and societal aspects that are key to implementation. Most research has been conducted with confined animals, and considerably more research is needed to develop, adapt, and evaluate antimethanogenic strategies for grazing systems. In general, few options are currently available for extensive production systems without feed supplementation. Continuous research and development are needed to develop enteric CH4 mitigation strategies that are locally applicable. Information is needed to calculate carbon footprints of interventions on a regional basis to evaluate the impact of mitigation strategies on net greenhouse gas emissions. Economically affordable enteric CH4 mitigation solutions are urgently needed. Successful implementation of safe and effective antimethanogenic strategies will also require delivery mechanisms and adequate technical support for producers, as well as consumer involvement and acceptance. The most appropriate metrics should be used in quantifying the overall climate outcomes associated with mitigation of enteric CH4 emissions. A holistic approach is required, and buy-in is needed at all levels of the supply chain. © 2022 American Dairy Science Association	Article	Scopus

Techniques used to chemically extract these compounds often neglect the intrinsic chemical characteristics of the molecules involved, such as the ability to form conjugate acids or bases and how they influence the solubilities of these molecules in organic solvents. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate how the pH of the fermented broth affects the process used to extract the secondary metabolites of the Diaporthe citri strain G-01 endophyte with ethyl acetate as the organic solvent. The analyzed samples, conducted by direct-infusion electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry, were grouped according to the pH of the fermented broth (i.e., <7 and ≥7). A more extreme pH (i.e., 2 or 12) was found to affect the chemical profile of the sample. Moreover, statistical analysis enabled us to determine the presence or absence of ions of high importance; for example, ions at 390.7 and 456.5 m/z were observed mainly at acidic pH, while 226.5, 298.3, and 430.1 m/z ions were observed at pH ≥ 7. Extraction at a pH between 4 and 9 may be of interest for exploring the differential secondary metabolites produced by endophytes. Furthermore, pH influences the chemical phenotype of the fungal metabolic extract. © 2022 by the authors.	Article	Scopus

Whether these replicas are taken at a same location to represent a specific point or at several locations to represent a larger area, the results should be merged into a final data set to be used in modeling. For this data set to be representative, standard errors and a correlation matrix must be considered in the merging process. We present a method to perform this merging and give an example using stochastic realizations of van Genuchten-Mualem (VGM) parameters generated by Cholesky decomposition to merge the SHP and associated statistics into a merged parameter set. To do so, we used VGM parameters obtained at sample scale in three replicas from a Brazilian savanna soil through inverse modeling of laboratory evaporation experiments. The effectiveness and representativeness of the proposed methodology were evaluated by observing the frequency distribution of different levels of output, comparing individual and merged sample properties. The outputs include VGM parameters, retention and conductivity characteristics, and water balance components stochastically predicted by a hydrological model. The performed stochastic merging correctly represented the variability of the combined replicas, especially with respect to hydrological model outputs of soil water balance components. Using the mean hydraulic property parameter values to deterministically predict water balance components may yield values that are substantially different from the mean values of stochastic realizations. This suggests that the deterministic prediction using mean parameter values in vadose zone hydrological modeling may result in unrepresentative outputs.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The rainforest-to-pasture conversion affects the methane cycle in upland soils, changing it from sink to source of atmospheric methane. However, it remains unknown if management practices could reduce the impact of land-use on methane cycling. In this work, we evaluated how pasture management can regulate the soil methane cycle either by maintaining continuous grass coverage on pasture soils, or by liming the soil to amend acidity. Methane fluxes from forest and pasture soils were evaluated in moisture-controlled greenhouse experiments with and without grass cover (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu) or liming. We also assessed changes in the soil microbial community structure of both bare (bulk) and rhizospheric pasture soils through high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and quantified the methane cycling microbiota by their respective marker genes related to methane generation (mcrA) or oxidation (pmoA). The experiments used soils from eastern and western Amazonia, and concurrent field studies allowed us to confirm greenhouse data. The presence of a grass cover not only increased methane uptake by up to 35% in pasture soils, but also reduced the abundance of the methane-producing community. In the grass rhizosphere this reduction was up to 10-fold. Methane-producing archaea belonged to the genera Methanosarcina sp., Methanocella sp., Methanobacterium sp., and Rice Cluster I. Further, we showed that soil liming to increasing pH compromised the capacity of forest and pasture soils to be a sink for methane, and instead converted formerly methane-consuming forest soils to become methane sources in only 40–80 days. Liming reduced the relative abundance of Beijerinckiacea family in forest soils, which account for many known methanotrophs. Our results demonstrate that pasture management that maintains grass coverage can mitigate soil methane emissions, compared to bare (bulk) pasture soil. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

The majority of the studies focus on the stand-alone use of proximal sensors in different wavelengths of the spectrum to get information on soil properties. Although sensors work on a specific spectral range, the combined use of sensors from different spectral ranges makes it easier to explore several kinds of information about the soil. This study aimed at carrying out a discriminant analysis of soil profiles, through the evaluation of data from different spectral ranges along the electromagnetic spectrum. The spectral ranges used included the X-ray (Portable X-Ray fluorescence (pXRF)), visible, near and short-wave infrared (Vis-NIR-SWIR, 350–2500 nm), and mid-infrared (Mid-IR, 2500–25,000 nm) ranges. The study had five main steps: 1) collecting soil samples; 2) acquiring spectral data; 3) identifying the most important spectral ranges for soil discrimination; 4) grouping analysis of soil profiles by color and spectral behavior by cluster analysis; and 5) characterizing and discriminating each group by their spectral behavior. The clustering using the combined spectral ranges (Vis-NIR-SWIR and Mid-IR) joined the soil profiles due to their spectral similarity. The qualitative analysis of the spectral curves allowed us to understand which were the soil properties that influenced the grouping by spectrum. The methodology used in this work was effective for soil discrimination, in terms of soil color, particle size distribution, mineralogy and drainage conditions. The combined use of Vis-NIR-SWIR and Mid-IR showed high efficiency in surveying and detailing information about soil profiles, contributing to its characterization and discrimination. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Our previous data reported the genus Methylocystis as one of the most abundant methanotrophs in these floodplain sediments. However, information on the functional potential and life strategies of these organisms living under seasonal flooding is still missing. Here, we described the first metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) of a Methylocystis sp. recovered from Amazonian floodplains sediments, and we explored its functional potential and ecological traits through phylogenomic, functional annotation, and pan-genomic approaches. Both phylogenomics and pan-genomics identified the closest placement of the bin.170_fp as Methylocystis parvus. As expected for Type II methanotrophs, the Core cluster from the pan-genome comprised genes for CH4 oxidation and formaldehyde assimilation through the serine pathway. Furthermore, the complete set of genes related to nitrogen fixation is also present in the Core. Interestingly, the MAG singleton cluster revealed the presence of unique genes related to nitrogen metabolism and cell motility. The study sheds light on the genomic characteristics of a dominant, but as yet unexplored methanotroph from the Amazonian floodplains. By exploring the genomic potential related to resource utilization and motility capability, we expanded our knowledge on the niche breadth of these dominant methanotrophs in the Amazonian floodplains. © 2022 by the authors.

A Holocene record of the Araçuaí River peatland in the Serra do Espinhaço Meridional, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, was studied using isotopic composition, environmental geochemistry, and phytolith analysis. As a result, it was possible to determine and quantify the main constituent elements of the peatland and the chronology of paleoenvironmental changes. Five phases of paleoenvironmental changes were inferred: Phase I – 8.9 to 6.6 cal kyr BP - cold local environment (high phytolith index), which was very wet (higher tree cover density and high occurrence of C3 plants) and with watershed instability (higher incidence of erosion and sedimentation); Phase II – 6.6 to 3.9 kyr - very cold local environment, with reduced moisture in relation to the previous phase (decrease of the temperature and mixture of C3 and C4 plants), and increased stability in the watershed, with episodes of erosion at the end of the phase; Phase III – 3.9 to 2.1 cal kyr BP – warmer, drier local environment in relation to the previous phase (increase in the temperature and decrease of tree cover density) and instability in the watershed, with an episode of temperature decrease and moisture increase (respective increase in the climatic phytolith index and in δ15N) in the middle of the phase; Phase IV – 2.1 to 0.25 kyr - colder climate, increased humidity in the local environment in relation to the previous phase (increase in Ic% and D/P and a decrease in the palm cover density phytolith index), and greater stability in the watershed; Phase V – 0.25 kyr to present - increase in temperature, decrease in humidity (decrease in Ic% and expansion of C4 plants), and increased instability in the watershed, possibly influenced by human activity. The results evidence that the Araçuaí River peatland records demonstrate Holocene climate variations, capable of providing information about the paleoenvironment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Metribuzin is often found in natural waters, which raises environmental concerns. Nanoencapsulation of this herbicide could be an alternative to reduce its losses to the environment and improve gains in its efficiency. However, there is a paucity of information about the behavior of nanoformulations of herbicides in environmental matrices. In this study, the stability of nanoencapsulated metribuzin in polymeric nanoparticles (nanoMTZ) was verified over time, as well as its dissipation in different soils, followed by the effects on soil enzymatic activity. The physiological parameters and control effects of nanoMTZ on Ipomoea grandifolia plants were investigated. No differences were verified in the half-life of nanoencapsulated metribuzin compared to a commercial formulation of the herbicide. Moreover, no suppressive effects on soil enzymatic activities were observed. The retention of nanoMTZ in the tested soils was lower compared to its commercial analogue. However, the mobility of nanoencapsulated metribuzin was not greatly increased, reflecting a low risk of groundwater contamination. Weed control was effective even at the lowest dose of nanoMTZ (48 g a.i. ha-1), which was consistent with the higher efficiency of nanoMTZ compared to the conventional herbicide in inhibiting PSII activity and decreasing pigment levels. Overall, we verified that nanoMTZ presented a low environmental risk, with increased weed control. © 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.	Article	Scopus

This study evaluated the enzymatic stoichiometry in soils from different physiognomies of the Brazilian Cerrado, trying to indicate a possible nutrient limitation in these areas. The enzymes β-glucosidase (BG), urease (U), and acid phosphatase (AP) were assessed in soil samples from three different physiognomies of Cerrado, namely, Campo Graminoide (CG), Cerrado Stricto Sensu (CSS), and Cerradão (CD). The activities of BG/U, BG/AP, and U/AP were used for calculating the enzymatic C/N, C/P, and N/P ratios, respectively. In addition, the vectors L and A, which are indirect indicators of P and N limitation to microbes, were assessed in soils. The enzymatic stoichiometry varied between physiognomies and seasons, with values of BG/U, BG/AP, and U/AP ratios being higher in the wet than the dry season. When comparing among physiognomies, the values of BG/U and BG/AP ratios increased from CG to CSS and CD. The vector A decreased from CG to CSS and CD. Together, the stoichiometry of enzymes approach and the analyses of vectors L and A suggest that soils from the different physiognomies of Cerrado could be P-limited. Thus, it requires further studies on P dynamics in Cerrado soils. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.	Article	Scopus

Considering the increasing suppression of native vegetation, riparian areas represent an important tool for protecting ecosystem services and biodiversity. Although the effects of land tenure and land use on large-scale deforestation in the Amazon have been widely assessed, their roles on riparian deforestation remains poorly explored. Here we assessed two municipalities – Querência (QRC) and São José do Xingu (SJX) – located in an agricultural frontier of the Brazilian Amazon to explore the relationship of illegal deforestation in riparian areas and different types of land use and property-sizes, as well as the impact of the Native Vegetation Protection Law (NVPL, Federal Law 12,651/2012) on environmental compliance. Therefore, we developed a robust geodatabase using hydrographic, land use and land tenure data. Riparian areas protected as Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs) were delimited and their land cover mapped for 2012 and 2018 using high spatial resolution satellite images and unsupervised K-means classification method. We also applied landscape metrics to analyze riparian PPA structure and dynamics. Our results indicated that NVPL was followed by a downward trend in the riparian vegetation deficits in all land use types and property-sizes, but it did not stop new clearings. Although riparian PPAs in minifundios (≤ 80 ha) and agrarian reform settlements tended to concentrate higher relative deforestation amounts, large-sized farms were responsible for most of the absolute extent of riparian deforestation in both years, accounting for 76–78% in QRC and 93% in SJX. They were also the main drivers of new clearings, for which account for 71% in QRC and 86% in SJX. The impact of land use on riparian deforestation was not homogeneous among properties, possibly reflecting different levels of technological investment and management techniques. In the so-called consolidated areas, in which the riparian PPA minimum width was reduced by NVPL, decreases in deforestation between 2012 and 2018 were lower. In these areas, vegetation coverage did not exceed 23% in any of the study areas. In the riparian PPAs that was not under consolidated areas, the vegetation coverage was of at least 85% of the area. Local environmental governance may also have affected the riparian deforestation dynamics, in which stricter monitoring and law enforcement lead to lower deforestation extents. Finally, landscape metrics revealed the importance of managing riparian areas at the landscape level, as local improvements did not necessarily result in connectivity gains. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

In this work, we isolated leaf endophytic fungi from Serjania laruotteana, identify them using multilocus analysis, and evaluate the genetic variability using IRAP (inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism) and REMAP (retrotransposon-microssatellite amplified polymorphism). A total of 261 fungi were isolated and 58 were identified. Multilocus phylogenetic analysis using the partial sequences from the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions, elongation factor 1-alpha, β-tubulin, actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and calmodulin genes identify that most strains belonged to the Colletotrichum and Diaporthe genera, other isolated genera were Xylaria, Phyllosticta, Muyocopron, Fusarium, Nemania, Plectosphaerella, Corynespora, Bipolaris, and Curvularia. The IRAP and REMAP analyzes were performed with Colletotrichum and Diaporthe genera and showed 100% of polymorphism and high intra- and interspecific variability. This is the first report of the diversity of endophytic fungi from S. laruotteana. In addition, it demonstrated that the IRAP and REMAP can be used to distinguish morphologically similar lineages, revealing differences even strains of the same species. © 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.

We tested the hypothesis that in this ecosystem, fine roots stimulate decomposition and nutrient release from leaf litter biochemically by releasing enzymes, and by exuding labile carbon stimulating microbial decomposers. Methods: We monitored leaf litter decomposition in a Central Amazon tropical rainforest, where fine roots were either present or excluded, over 188 days and added labile carbon substrates (glucose and citric acid) in a fully factorial design. We tracked litter mass loss, remaining carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and cation concentrations, extracellular enzyme activity and microbial carbon and nutrient concentrations. Results: Fine root presence did not affect litter mass loss but significantly increased the loss of phosphorus and cations from leaf litter. In the presence of fine roots, acid phosphatase activity was 43.2% higher, while neither microbial stoichiometry, nor extracellular enzyme activities targeting carbon- and nitrogen-containing compounds changed. Glucose additions increased phosphorus loss from litter when fine roots were present, and enhanced phosphatase activity in root exclusions. Citric acid additions reduced litter mass loss, microbial biomass nitrogen and phosphorus, regardless of fine root presence or exclusion. Conclusions: We conclude that plant roots release significant amounts of acid phosphatases into the litter layer and mobilize phosphorus without affecting litter mass loss. Our results further indicate that added labile carbon inputs (i.e. glucose) can stimulate acid phosphatase production by microbial decomposers, highlighting the potential importance of plant-microbial feedbacks in tropical forest ecosystems. © 2021, The Author(s).

Individualizing the effects of these drivers on paleoecological records is a challenge. This was addressed by pollen analysis along three cores sampled from lakes on a coastal plateau, primarily influenced by rainfall, and from a fluvial valley, influenced by sea-level and fluvial discharge, in northeastern Brazil. Pollen records from the fluvial valley indicated the presence of mangroves along an estuary in the mid-Holocene. During the past ~5800 cal yr BP, mangroves, adapted to brackish water, were replaced by herbaceous vegetation adapted to freshwater in the fluvial valley. Concurrently (~5680–240 cal yr BP), expansion of Atlantic Forest and contraction of herbaceous vegetation occurred on the coastal plateau. This divergence of pollen records between two distinct sedimentary environments (lakes on a coastal plateau and fluvial valleys) was attributed to RSL and climate effects. The combination of RSL fall and higher fluvial discharge favored seaward mangrove migration and expansion of herbaceous vegetation along the fluvial valley during the mid-late Holocene. However, the increase in rainfall on the coastal plateau favored the expansion of arboreal vegetation and contraction of herbaceous vegetation. At ~1700 CE, an abrupt shift from arboreal to herbaceous vegetation occurred on the coastal plateau. This vegetation change is likely attributed to European colonization on the southern coast of the state of Bahia, which was colonized by Portuguese navigators ~1500 CE. Part of the Atlantic Forest has naturally regenerated and was preserved as a national park in recent decades. This study showed that although the sampling sites are close, pollen assemblages can differ considerably depending on the depositional environment. Therefore, pollen analyses in different depositional environments are necessary to assess individually driving forces impacts on coastal vegetation dynamics during the Holocene. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to evaluate changes caused by successive applications of PS and mineral fertilizer on soil aggregation and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in aggregates of a clayey Typic Hapludox cultivated with Cynodon dactylon cv. Tifton-85 in southern Brazil. The treatments consisted of six annual applications of PS (100, 200, 300, and 400 kg N ha−1) and urea (200 kg N ha−1), and a control with no fertilizer application. Soil samples were collected in March 2019 and evaluated for aggregate stability, through the geometric mean diameter of aggregates (GMD), and GMD sensitivity index (SIGMD), and mass of macro-, meso-, and microaggregates. Total organic carbon and nitrogen contents were determined in macroaggregates and microaggregates. Applications of PS to pasture soils increase dry matter production of Tifton-85 and can increase soil aggregation by increasing the mass of macroaggregates. The highest PS rates decreased aggregate stability, resulting in lower macroaggregate mass, GMD, and SIGMD, and higher microaggregate mass. PS applications to pasture soils can increase C and N contents in macro and microaggregates, and improve soil aggregation when using the rates of 100 or 200 kg N ha−1, mainly in subsurface layers. © 2022 by the authors.

Several factors, such as the presence of phosphorus, micronutrients, and organic matter, contribute to phytoplankton proliferation and the production of off-flavors. Geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol are the most common off-flavors that confer the smell of earth or mold to water and fish. These metabolites are not considered toxic, but they can be easily transferred from water to living organisms and accumulate in the biota, up the trophic levels and to consumers, including fish species. Numerous processes have been studied to eliminate or reduce the presence of off-flavors in recirculating aquaculture systems. Managing off-flavors must be eco-friendly and consumer-friendly. Strategies against off-flavors must be efficient and low-cost. However, these solutions may be different for each fish production system. We review herein the main compounds produced by cyanobacteria that can accumulate in fish used in aquaculture that can affect the quality of food, as well as production costs and consumer preference. © 2022 by the authors.

The mechanisms involved in Si to mitigate this stress may be linked to decreasing oxidative stress and increasing phenolic compounds, associated with stoichiometric homeostasis of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and Si, although there is a lack of research especially in forage crops. This research aimed to evaluate whether the supply of Si via fertigation improves the antioxidant defense system and modifies the C/N/Si stoichiometry and the growth of two cultivars of Panicum maximum cultivated under two soil water regimes (70 and 40% water retention capacity). Two experiments were developed, and the same treatments were applied using a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, with Si applied via fertigation (2.5 mmol L−1) to the soil, while the control (without Si) was combined with two levels of soil moisture (70 and 40% of the soil water retention capacity). The two cultivars showed high accumulation of silicon in the shoot, low C content, low C/Si and C/N ratios, and high nutritional efficiency for the use of C in both water conditions. This is related to the potential of the Si to provide the greater antioxidant defense owing to higher production of phenolic compounds and decreased electrolyte leakage index. There was an increase in relative water content, leaf water potential, total chlorophyll content, and quantum efficiency of photosystem II, as shown by greater growth and dry mass production. Si application is a promising strategy to mitigate water deficit, ensuring new physiological and nutritional homeostasis, contributing to a more sustainable agriculture by means of feeding the herds that depend on pasturelands. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

The effects of this driver on the boreal limits of mangroves need to be investigated for projecting the fate of mangroves in the face of global warming. Based on QuickBird, aerial/drone images, and historic air/seawater temperatures, this work analyzed the 2017–2018 winter freeze impacts on mangroves of Bay Champagne, Louisiana, USA. This winter freeze, marked by 14 days of subfreezing daily minimum temperatures, degraded ~90% (111 ha) of the studied mangroves. This macroclimatic setting caused defoliation and dry branches on Avicennia trees. Such degradation occurred mainly in mangroves established after 2004, where trees of low heights (1–1.5 m) and density between 1000 and 10,000 trees/ha were present mainly on topographically lower tidal flats (13–26 cm above mean sea-level). By contrast, healthy Avicennia trees were typically taller (1.5–2.2 m), growing at intermediate-density (4000–8000 trees/ha) stands, and occupying higher grounds (20–46 cm) in the inner part of mangrove areas. Canopy height and tree density modulated the winter freeze damages on Avicennia trees, as these factors attenuated the wind impacts along a microclimatic gradient. The microtopography of tidal flats may have also influenced the Avicennia degradation. The recovery of mangroves was rapid (~1 year) and regulated by a microclimatic and microtopographic gradient. Winter freeze impacts on mangroves will probably be attenuated as the increase in the stature and density of mangrove trees. These processes could contribute to the continued northward expansion of mangroves. However, recurring winter freezes affect mangrove productivity that is a critical factor for mangroves to keep pace with relative sea-level rise (SLR). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

These actions had consequences for Forest's biodiversity, including the soil. In this sense, a better understanding of how long-term land use affects soil microbial communities, and their functions is urgent. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term land-use effects over bacterial and archaeal communities in soil and soybean rhizosphere in the Amazon region. For this, mesocosms experiments were carried out with Amazon soils with a history of 2-, 8-, and 20-years of agricultural use. We then assessed the bacterial and archaeal communities based on the 16S rRNA sequencing and real-time PCR. Our results showed a distinct bacterial community structure in soils with 20-years of land use. For both, bulk soil and soybean rhizosphere with 20-years of use, there was an increase in the abundance of Gemmatimonadetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes. Interestingly, the niche occupancy analysis revealed an increase of specialist microbes in these soils. Also, these soils with 20-years of use showed a more complex network for both bulk and rhizosphere samples, highlighting the importance of Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi phyla to soil network structure. Our analysis also revealed an increased abundance of total bacteria, N-fixers, and ammonia-oxidizers bacteria in rhizosphere soil with 20-years of use. In addition, based on the potential functional analysis, nitrification processes increased in those soils. However, we noticed a homogenization in the abundance of the genes between rhizosphere and bulk soil with 20-years of use. In general, the differences were associated with changes in soil chemical characteristics such as pH, Ca2+, Mg2+, and organic matter, which are a consequence of liming and no-till practices over time. Our findings demonstrate that long-term agriculture in Amazon soils affects microbial community composition and functions, bringing new insights to better understand anthropogenic actions over the soil microbiome. © 2022	Article	Scopus

To contribute to the understanding of these com-munities, here we describe metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) recovered from 12 forest and pasture soil metagenomes of the Brazilian Eastern Amazon. We obtained 11 forest and 30 pasture MAGs (≥50% of completeness and ≤10 % of contamina-tion), distributed among two archaeal and 11 bacterial phyla. The taxonomic classification results suggest that most MAGs may represent potential novel microbial taxa. MAGs selected for further evaluation included members of Acidobacteriota, Actinobac-teriota, Desulfobacterota_B, Desulfobacterota_F, Dormibacterota, Eremiobacterota, Halobacteriota, Proteobacteria, and Thermopro-teota, thus revealing their roles in carbohydrate degradation and mercury detoxification as well as in the sulphur, nitrogen, and methane cycles. A methane-producing Archaea of the genus Methanosarcina was almost exclusively recovered from pasture soils, which can be linked to a sink-to-source shift after the forest-to-pasture conversion. The novel MAGs constitute an impor-tant resource to help us unravel the yet-unknown microbial diversity in Amazonian soils and its functional potential and, con-sequently, the responses of these microorganisms to land-use change. © 2022 The Authors.

However, the link between biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem processes is not fully understood. We conducted an experiment to evaluate whether the exclusion of vertebrates affects the decomposition rates of different litter types (grass, a pioneer species and a mix of litters from a well preserved secondary forest). To answer this question, we placed litter bags inside artificial exclusion plots that were built in two types of vegetation coverage (abandoned pastureland and preserved forest) in the Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil. Our hypothesis is that vertebrate exclusion will change decomposition rates of different litter types due to the top-down cascade effect on soil invertebrates. We found out that vertebrate exclusion did not affect decomposition rates, possibly due to the overlap of ecological functions in the soil fauna responsible for the decomposition process. Furthermore, grass litter was decomposed faster (k value), possibly due to its initial nutrient content and hence litter quality which plays a significant role on decomposition rates. © 2021, International Society for Tropical Ecology.

It has a disjunct distribution with six endemic species restricted to the central Andes of South America and one species endemic to Mexico. The phylogeny and taxonomy of this genus have been extensively studied. Nevertheless, pollen data are still insufficiently known within a taxonomic context. In this study, we analysed all Amicia species using light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy and we present phylogenetically useful palynological information to support taxonomic studies. Variation in pollen grain size and aperture features is used to delimit pollen types, which corroborate molecular and biogeographical data. Multivariate analysis reinforced the pollen type subdivisions and revealed novel diagnostic morphological features for two infrageneric taxa of Amicia. Our pollen results provide informative pollen characters to assist in the delimitation of Amicia species, which can be easily misidentified due to similarities in vegetative structures. Amicia pollen morphology reflects population isolation and divergence of Amicia lineages and provides critical features for future phylogenetic optimisation of the Adesmia clade. © 2022 Collegium Palynologicum Scandinavicum.

The experimental design was a complete randomised block design with five replications and eight treatments, as follows: monocrop of cherry tomato adding residual maize crop residue (straw) as a mulch (control), monocrop of cherry tomato without the addition of maize crop residue (control), cherry tomatoes intercropped with jack bean, sun hemp, dwarf velvet bean, mung bean, white lupin or cowpea bean grown as green manures. In this production system, which was evaluated between 2011 and 2013, maize was cultivated from January to April, and the cherry tomatoes, with or without leguminous green manures, were grown from May/July to November/December. The number and weight of total and marketable fruits of tomatoes were 70%–88% higher in 2011 than in 2012 and the number of damaged fruits was 12% lower in 2011 than in 2012. In 2011, the weights of total and marketable fruits in the intercropping treatment with white lupin were lower than that in the controls and in the intercropping treatments with dwarf velvet and cowpea bean. The white lupin and sun hemp green manures produced the highest biomass dry weight, followed by the jack bean, cowpea bean, mung bean and dwarf velvet bean. The different treatments had no effect on the yield of the maize. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.	Article	Scopus

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Ni sources, i.e., different size particles, on germination rate of soybean seeds, and uptake/translocation of Ni by roots and seeds in soybean. For this, seeds were treated with macrometric Ni-sulfate (hereafter called Macro-NiSO4), micrometric Ni-hydroxide (Micro-Ni(OH)2), nanometric Ni-hydroxide (Nano-Ni(OH)2) particles, and negative control without Ni application; evaluated by X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. The results show that seeds treated with Nano-Ni(OH)2 had wider Ni distribution in the seeds and into the radicle, while the treatment with Micro-Ni(OH)2 particles resulted in Ni diffused around the seeds. Regardless of the Ni-source type, the coated seeds had hotspots of high Ni in the hilum, but no transfer of Ni into the cotyledons. The application of Macro-NiSO4 and Micro-Ni(OH)2 particle had a positive impact on early seedling development increasing germination rate, root length and Ni distribution in the tissues. These results bring to light that in all treatments, Ni remained attached to the seed coat (especially the hilum) and did not move towards the emerging cotyledons, being transferred to the rhizosphere soil afterwards, and finally was taken up by the radicle, or seedling primary roots. However, further studies are necessary to define the proper Nano-Ni(OH)2 rate on soybean seeds avoiding excessive Ni uptake and impaired initial root development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

This study aimed to investigate the leaf absorption and translocation of potassium from potassium sulfate, potassium nitrate, potassium formate, potassium acetate, and potassium carbonate in soybean leaves. Potassium was applied on soybean leaf surfaces at a concentration of 3 g of K L-1 and subsequently monitored over 144 h using X-ray fluorescence microanalysis. The results showed that the highest absorption rates were for potassium carbonate, potassium acetate, and potassium formate. Potassium after absorption was translocated to other tissues, and the sources that were well absorbed also allowed better translocation. This study reinforces that the counterion not only influences the uptake but also plays a role in phloem loading. © 2021 American Chemical Society.	Article	Scopus

Here, we report the first evidence of an extant freshwater sponge fauna in Jackson Lake, Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming (USA). Two sponge species were identified living in shallow littoral and shoreline environments: Eunapius fragilis (Leidy 1851) and Ephydatia muelleri (Lieberkühn 1856). The spicules of  Eunapius fragilis present high morphological variability, in contrast to gemmuloscleres reported in specimens from lakes and rivers in southern South America and eastern North America. Ephydatia muelleri also exhibits morphological differences in comparison to published examples, chiefly related to the spines on megascleres. The megascleres of Ephydatia muelleri are straight or slightly curved, sharpening gradually toward the apices, with completely smooth surfaces (13%), surfaces with minimal spines (65%), or highly spined surfaces in the central area (22%). These morphological differences in the Ephydatia muelleri megascleres suggest the potential for ecophenotypic effects in Jackson Lake. Furthermore, the morphological and ecological variability of Eunapius fragilis and Ephydatia muelleri observed in Jackson Lake suggest the need for further studies of the Nearctic to understand if a species complex exists or if morphological dissimilarities are indicative of true taxonomic differences and therefore multiple new species. This study expands the biogeography of freshwater sponges and provides the first documentation of benthic sessile filter feeders in Jackson Lake, a key source of ecosystem services. © 2022 International Society of Limnology (SIL).

In this context, we investigated the combined effects of N application levels and inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense on maize plant biomass, grain yield, agronomic efficiency (AE), and N content in plants, focusing on the economic feasibility of maize production systems. The field trial involved four N application levels (control, low, average and high, i.e., 0, 50, 100 and 200 kg ha−1, respectively, applied as sidedress) either with seed inoculation with A. brasilense or without inoculation. Inoculation with A. brasilense enhanced AE and N uptake in maize plants with increased shoot, root and grain N accumulation, augmenting grain yield by 7%. The increase in total N accumulation was mainly the result of improved N-NH4+ accumulation in plant roots and shoots. Our results showed that it is possible to reduce the N fertilization level by 50% while increasing the operating profit by 11% with A. brasilense inoculation. Additionally, when inoculation was performed in the presence of a high N level, the operating profit was 11% higher than that for the same N level in the absence of inoculation. Therefore, in view of the low economic cost, ease of application, and high probability of a positive response by maize crops, even in the presence of different N application levels, inoculation with A. brasilense has the potential to be a key technology for improving plant-soil N management, leading to more sustainable maize production under tropical conditions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Since their introduction, several tools have been developed for generating these representations at the single residue level (amino acids or nucleotides). We have developed a tool to build sequence logos of protein-coding sequences at the codon level, allowing more accurate analysis of coding-sequences as they represent synonymous and non-synonymous changes instead of showing only changes that imply on amino acid substitutions. We built CoCoView on top of the Logomaker Python API. It creates codon sequence logos from a multiple sequence alignment of protein-coding sequences. Some properties of the data and the generated logos can be controlled by the end-users, such as data redundancy, plot type and alphabet color. • Split aligned sequences into codon positions; • For each position compute codon frequency and information content; • Use the computed information to plot the graphic. © 2022 The Author(s)	Article	Scopus

Although most attention has been on modulation of the rumen microbiome to improve ruminant production, the role of the lower gut microbiome in host health and nutrition remains relatively unexplored. This work aimed to investigate the taxonomy and functional variations in the fecal microbiome of Brazilian beef cattle reared in two different production systems using a metagenomic approach. Sixty male beef cattle from six farms representing semi-intensive (I, n = 2) and traditional (T, n = 4) Brazilian beef production systems were enrolled in the study. Shotgun sequencing was used to characterize taxonomic and functional composition and diversity of the microbiome in fecal samples collected from each animal. Fecal samples were analyzed for copper (Cu), lead (Pb), nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) and stable isotopes of carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N). The fecal microbiome was influenced by the beef production systems with greater functional and lower taxonomic diversity in beef cattle feces from I systems compared with that from T systems. The concentration of N, P, and Zn was higher in beef cattle feces from I systems compared with that from T systems and was associated with taxonomic and functional profile of fecal microbiome in I system, suggesting the role of fecal nutrients in shaping system-specific microbiome. Semi-intensive management practices led to a more complex but less connected fecal microbiome in beef cattle. The microbial community in beef cattle feces from I systems was characterized by greater abundance of beneficial bacteria (phylum Firmicutes and butyrate-producing bacteria family Lachnospiraceae and genera Anaerostipes, Blautia, Butyrivibrio, Eubacterium, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus). In addition, the fecal abundance of microbial genes related to immune system, nutrient metabolism, and energy production was greater in beef cattle raised under I systems compared with that under T systems.

African grasses are the most invasive plants in the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna), but their impact on C and N stocks is poorly known. We compared patterns of C and N stocks in the aboveground biomass, root biomass and soil in open Cerrado (campo sujo) sites, both uninvaded and invaded by the African grass Urochloa decumbens. In both sites we estimated the aboveground biomass of U. decumbens and native grasses, as well as the root biomass up to 50 cm. We obtained C and N soil content and soil bulk density up to 1 m depth, which were used to obtain the overall soil C and N stocks; we also assessed the variation in soil δ13C and δ15N. Although invasion did not affect the aboveground biomass, it did affect belowground biomass, leading to more C stocked in fine roots and soil, higher N concentration close to soil surface, and also more C along the soil profile. C and N soil stocks, soil δ13C and δ15N values did not significantly differ between invaded and uninvaded site. Even a relatively low level of invasion by U. decumbens changed the root distribution pattern and increased C and N contents in the upper soil, which may promote ecosystem changes by altering nutrient dynamics. Although our study was conducted at a single site, it clearly shows effects of the invasive species on the belowground environment, and indicates the necessity of further studies. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH	Article	Scopus

However, it remains unclear if those publications only mention “soil quality” in a broad context, or the studies are focused on soil quality assessments, integrating soil chemical, physical and biological indicators. The objective of this systematic review was to carry out a critical analysis of the conception in using the term “soil quality” in recent publications derived from studies performed in Brazil. For this purpose, the terms [(“soil health” or “soil quality” or “qualidade do solo”) and (“Brazil*” or “Brasil*”)] were searched in databases of Web of Science, Scopus, and Scielo from 2014 to 2021. Initially, 1,284 peer-reviewed papers were found, subsequently selected according to the criteria established in two filters: (i) First filter-studies carried out in Brazil, which mentioned at least one of the terms of interest (“soil health” or “soil quality” or “qualidade do solo”) and that evaluated soil biological, physical or chemical indicators, assessing at least one of them; (ii) Second filter-studies in which all three groups of soil indicators were assessed and integrated, and presented a specific discussion about soil quality. According to the results, 36 % of the papers met the first criteria (n = 464), and only 2 % (n = 30) attended the second filter. The terms “soil health” or “soil quality” or “qualidade do solo” were mentioned 7 and 37 times per paper for those papers selected in the first and second filter, respectively. We evidenced in our study that the term soil quality in agricultural science papers has been predominantly used in a broad context, mostly to refer to the suitable soil conditions for plant growth. Thus, we concluded that even if the use of soil quality term is increasing in Brazilian literature, there are still very few researchers working specifically with soil quality assessments, in its full conception (i.e., integrating chemical, physical and biological indicators). Therefore, there is a promising research field to be explored to promote scientific advances in the soil quality area (e.g., new concepts, assessment frameworks, on-farm monitoring protocols), as well as disseminate the soil quality assessment among the Brazilian farmers, environmentalists, and other stakeholders. © 2022, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

Stemflow variability can affect the hydrology, ecology, and soil chemistry patterns. However, the influence of canopy structure and rainfall characteristics on stemflow production in sugarcane plantations which are important for renewable energy production remain poorly understood. By using funnels attached to the sugarcane stems, the present study determined the stemflow amount during the period of sugarcane growth and its relationship with plant development. Approximately, 14% of gross rainfall reached the soil as stemflow, and the funneling ratios was 60. In general, it was observed a positive relationship between stemflow rates with both leaf area index and plant height. This was attributed to an increasing number of acute branching angles of the sugarcane leaves as well as high stem tillering and density. However, at the end of growth cycle, stemflow rate was lower than in previous periods which can be attributed to changes in sugarcane canopy such as stems inclination and lodging, reducing the effectiveness of water conveyance along the stem. Our study showed the need to include stemflow to better understand the hydrology of sugarcane plantations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) inoculations are considered one of the most promising and safe strategy to alleviate environmental alterations in context of climatic extremes to improve plant nutrition while reducing dependency of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application. This study investigated the interactive effects of N levels and inoculation with A. brasilense on plant biomass, grain yield, agronomic efficiency (AE) of applied N, apparent N-fertilizer recovery (AFR) and N content in plant targeting economic feasibility of wheat production system. The field trial tested 4 N application levels applied in side-dressing (control, low, average and high; named 0, 50, 100 and 200 kg N ha−1) and two inoculations (without and with A. brasilense seed inoculation). The results exhibited that inoculation with A. brasilense enhanced AE, AFR and N uptake in wheat plants with increased root and shoot N accumulation and grain N accumulation under average and high N application levels. In addition, inoculation increased root and shoot biomass, leading to a yield increase of 10.3% compared with non-inoculated plants. Wheat plant inoculation associated with application of the average N level provided the greatest profitability. Furthermore, results showed that reducing N fertilization from 100 to 50 kg N ha−1 along A. brasilense inoculation led to an increase in operating profit of 10.5%. In view of low economic cost, ease of application, and high probability of a positive response by wheat crops, even associated with different N application levels, the inoculation with A. brasilense prone to be a key sustainable management practice to improve wheat production under tropical conditions. This practice has the potential to increase wheat grain yield, N use and uptake, and overall farm profitability.

Thus, our aim was to evaluate the efficiency of the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) in a typical tropical soil by evaluating the fate of nitrogen (N-NO3−, N-NH4+ and total N in soil and leached water), N accumulation and N recovery by cotton plants and soil. Methods: Leaching columns with cotton plants were used to assess N-NO3− and N-NH4+ losses in drainage water. The treatments consisted of three N levels applied in side-dressing (corresponding to 50, 100 and 150 kg N ha−1) as 15N-urea with and without DMPP application. An additional treatment (absence of N application in side-dressing) was used as a control. Results: 3,4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate efficiently improved N recovery after urea fertilizer was applied to plants and in the soil by reducing NO3− leaching, leading to enhanced N acquisition from fertilizer and soil and augmenting N accumulation in plants, mainly when high N levels above 100 kg N ha−1 were applied. We found that total N recovery increased 31% when 150 kg N ha−1 was applied as a urea + DMPP source compared to the application of conventional urea. In addition, DMPP application reduced NO3− leaching losses (by approximately 11 to 20%), although it had no significant effect on the shoot or root dry matter yields. Conclusion: The reduction in NO3− leaching losses obtained herein highlights the potential of DMPP to mitigate the impact of increased urea inputs on leaching losses, thereby improving N use efficiency and N uptake in cotton crops. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Additionally, principal components analysis was done to elucidate patterns of variation among the species. Pollen grains are small to medium size, isopolar, prolate spheroidal to prolate, 3-zonocolporate, colporus with operculum, membrane and margo are ornamented. Five pollen types are recognised and described based on mesocolpium exine ultrasculpture. Exine consists of a compact tectum, eutectate, tectate perforate to semitectate, the infratectum is collumelar and granular, foot layer discontinuous to absent in aperture region and endexine is continuous. A comprehensive description of the operculum, membrane ornamentations and the ultrastructure of exine were given for all species in the genus, nine of which were not previously analysed palynologically. Systematic implications of the palynological variations found in the literature and through light, scanning and transmission electron microscopical analyses were discussed. This article describes the importance of the characterisation of Poiretia pollen grains, which contributes to the systematics of the Adesmia informal clade. The class of endoaperture, ultrasculpture of mesocolpium and apocolpium, and ultrastructure of tectum, foot layer, and endexine support the eurypalynous status of Poiretia and are useful to recognise some species that have problematic delimitation (P. latifolia, P. coriifolia, P. unifoliolata, P. mattogrossensis, P. elegans, P. marginata) as well as groups of species. © 2022 Collegium Palynologicum Scandinavicum.

Application as a soil fertilizer is feasible due to its high organic matter and nutrient (e.g. Ca, Fe, Zn, and Cu) contents, but it critically depends on a previous chemical analysis. In this sense, laser-induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS) deserves attention for skipping sample decomposition and due to the multi-elementary capacity. LIBS quantitative analysis requires proper calibration approaches to overcome matrix effects, mainly for complex samples as sludge. This work aims to propose an analytical method to directly determine Ca, Fe, Zn, and Cu in sludge by LIBS, after the evaluation of different calibration approaches: external calibration (EC), internal standard calibration (ISC), multi-energy calibration (MEC) and slope ratio calibration (SRC). EC, carried out using four certified reference materials (CRMs) with a similar composition to sludge samples, did not yield accurate analytical results. The differences between sample and standard ablated masses were successfully compensated for using carbon as the internal standard, except for Cu. MEC yielded accurate results for all analytes (relative errors <5%), requiring only a single standard for calibration. Its main drawback is the need for at least 3 interference-free emission lines. The simplest and more practical calibration approach, also applicable with a single standard, but requiring only the response monitored at a single emission wavelength, was SRC, which yielded accurate results, as demonstrated by agreement with certified values at the 95% confidence level and relative errors <21%. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Aquatic insects have a key role in energy transference from streams to terrestrial systems since emergent insects contribute to the diet of riparian predators. If streams are polluted, emergent insects may act as pollutant conveyors from water to land. Our objective was to investigate if insects inhabiting streams contaminated by heavy metals accumulate, biomagnify, and transfer metals to land. We selected eight streams with different levels of pollution and three metallic pollutants: copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn). We sampled (i) water and sediments, (ii) organic matter, macrophytes, and biofilm, (iii) aquatic insects, and (iv) riparian spiders (land predators). We classified the organisms in functional feeding groups (FFG) and used the nitrogen stable isotope (δ15N) to determine the position of organisms in the food web. We found that contaminants in the sediments, but not in the water, were related to contaminant concentrations in biological samples. Biomagnification processes were metal dependent: Cu was biomagnified, Mn underwent biodilution, and no tendency was observed for Zn. The emergence of aquatic insects from metal-polluted rivers is a potential way of Cu, not Mn or Zn, flux to land. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Hydroponic lettuce cultivation has grown due to the viability of harvesting throughout the year. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the agronomic characteristics, color, and preference of curly lettuce in the NFT hydroponic system. Six lineages (6601-1A, 6601-2L, 7016-6A, 7119-1B, 7223-1A, and 7224-4A) and two commercial cultivars (Brida and Vanda) of lettuce were used, in a completely randomized blocks design with four replications. Shoot length, root length, stem length, number of leaves, stem diameter, plant diameter, shoot fresh mass, root fresh mass, chlorophyll content, instrumental color, and sensory characteristics were evaluated. As for agronomic evaluation, the bolting of 6601-2L lettuce was relevant in different attributes. The Vanda lettuce and the lineage 7016-6A presented best performances for shoot fresh mass (399.44 and 378.63 g, respectively), while the lineages 7119-1B and 6601-2L present the worst performance (279.50 and 273.13 g, respectively). There was variation in chlorophyll content and luminosity, however, the evaluators did not notice differences between lettuces for brightness or green color, as well as for crunchy texture. Lettuces 6601-2L, 7224-4A, 6601-1A, Brida, 7223-1A, and 7119-1B were preferred. The variation among plants may be due to different situations, such as harvesting times and bolting, and a direct relationship between agronomic properties and preference among lettuces has not been established yet. © 2021, University Federal de Uberlandia.

It was hypothesized that the reasons behind this fact relate to C:N:P stoichiometric modifications in these species that impair the conversion rates of accumulated nutrients in the stems, which could be attenuated by supplying silicon (Si) to the crops. Thus, the aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of water deficit in sugarcane and energy cane ratoons in the presence and absence of Si, in the C:N:P stoichiometry of stems, in the use efficiency of these nutrients and in the accumulation of dry matter in stems. Two experiments were carried out, using sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and energy cane (S. spontaneum), cultivated in pots filled with a Typic Quartzipisamment. The treatments for both experiments were arranged in a factorial scheme 2 × 2, without (70% of the soil’s water retention capacity) and with (30% of the capacity) water deficit, without and with the application of Si via fertirrigation, associated with foliar pulverization, both at a concentration of 2.5 mmol L−1, arranged in randomized blocks. The reduction in dry matter production of stems in both species caused by water deficit was due to modifications of the C, N and P stoichiometric homeostasis, but the benefit of Si in these plants when increasing dry matter production was not a reflection of the change in homeostasis, thus it may be involved in other mechanisms that remain unknown and should be further studied. © 2021, The Author(s).

A randomized block design was adopted with the treatments arranged in a 3 x 2 factorial scheme, with the factors consisting of cropping systems and grazing cycles. Grass in the mixed species pastures had a greater leaf/stem ratio than in the monoculture. Total forage mass was greater in the mixed pastures, which had the highest concentrations of crude protein and total digestible nutrients, the lowest fibre concentration, and the highest in vitro dry matter digestibility. Legumes were grazed with the highest frequency, and biting rate was highest in Andropogon gayanus with Stylosanthes sp. The highest intake (kg/day) was found in the mixed swards and the highest animal weight gain (143 g/day) in the mixed pastures. The pastures of Andropogon gayanus mixed with Stylosanthes sp. and C. mucunoides showed improved forage nutritive value and intake compared with the grass monoculture. © 2022, South African Journal of Animal Sciences.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of three approaches using the combined performance of four internal markers: indigestible dry matter (iDM); indigestible neutral detergent fiber (iNDF); titanium (Ti); and the isotopic signature of carbon (δ13C). These markers were used to predict the individual intakes of sheep that were fed grass and forage legumes. Twenty-one Santa Inês sheep were randomly divided according to three diets: 100% Megathyrsus maximus cv. Aruana grass (CTL diet); 25% inclusion (as fed basis) of Macrotyloma axillare legume (MAC diet); and 50% inclusion (as fed basis) of Stizolobium aterrimum legume (MUC diet). After the 10-day diet adaptation period, the animals were transferred to individual metabolic cages, where they were kept for seven days with daily measurements and collection of feed offerings, feed leftovers, and feces samples. The iDM and iNDF fractions of the samples were determined after 240 h of in situ incubation. The natural Ti concentration was determined by benchtop energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (EDXRF). The abundance of 13C was determined by mass spectrometry. The accuracy of the predictions of digestibility and intake was increased when the fecal recovery rate of the internal markers (P < 0.05) was corrected. The proportion of grass and legumes in the feces was accurately predicted by the 13C method. The combined use of iNDF and 13C markers could be an alternative for predicting individual digestibility and intake of grasses and legumes by animals that are fed mixed diets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The application of lime to soil is recommended for eucalyptus plantation, but lime reduces the availability of metallic micronutrients to plants. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the performance of field-grown Eucalyptus grandis in Ferralsol amended with lime at different rates (0.0 and 1.6 and 3.7 Mg ha-1) and Cu plus Zn [0.0 and 0.0 kg ha-1 (-CuZn) and 0.5 and 1.5 kg ha-1 (+CuZn)]. The soil chemical attributes, shoot biomass, and nutrient accumulation were evaluated, while nutrient use efficiency, chlorophyll (Chl) and flavonoid (Flav) contents, and enzymatic antioxidant performance [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX)] were assayed to assess the nutritional status of the plants. Despite the lime application rate increasing Ca and Mg soil availabilities, effective cation exchange capacity (eCEC), base saturation (BS), and pH values, the available Cu, Fe, and Zn concentrations decreased at 6 and 30 months after planting. Conversely, Mn soil availability increased with lime application rates. Liming augmented Cu-, Fe-, Mn-, and Zn-use efficiency, while +CuZn supply increased enzymatic antioxidant performance in 30-month-old plant. Overall, the combined application of lime and +CuZn enhanced shoot biomass relative to that of non-treated plants. However, there was no observed difference in shoot biomass in 30-month-old limed and non-limed eucalyptus trees that were supplied with +CuZn. This result can be partially explained by the improvement in soil chemical attributes, such as soil pH, eCEC, and BS. In conclusion, the use of integrative approaches and temporal evaluations provided new insights into wood yield, biochemical traits, antioxidant metabolism, and the nutritional status of field-grown eucalyptus under lime and +CuZn application rates. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The evolution of plants and animals had a direct relationship with the elements’ changes in the atmosphere and the development of the biogeochemical cycles on Earth. The Anthropocene is the age of the Homo sapiens leaves its geological signature on the planet. Human domination and/or interference in the biogeochemical cycles results in an environmental change that affects not only ecosystems, in general, but also the biota and global biodiversity. In this way, we are creating another mass extinction event, the “sixth extinction wave” as well as transforming the ecosystems’ functions and services. © 2022, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of surface and injected applications of pig slurry to soils under a no-tillage system on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) contents in particle-size fractions of the SOM. The no-tillage system included a crop rotation with grass species, summer maize, and winter black oat and wheat grown from 2011 to 2015. The treatments consisted of injected application of pig slurry, surface applications of pig slurry, application of chemical fertiliser (NPK), and a control with no soil fertiliser application. The 0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm soil layers were evaluated for SOC and STN contents, and for particle-size fractions: particulate organic carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, mineral-associated organic carbon, and mineral-associated organic nitrogen. We also evaluated the carbon and nitrogen contents and mass in the light organic matter. The injection of pig slurry increased carbon and nitrogen contents of all SOM fractions compared to surface application of pig slurry. These results suggest that the use of injected pig slurry to the soil under crop rotation in no-tillage reduces carbon and nitrogen losses by volatilisation and emissions to the atmosphere. We recommend the application of pig slurry by injecting in soil because it promotes higher increases in the SOM fractions. This form of application of pig slurry to the soil was shown as an effective and environmentally sustainable method for the conservation and improvement of soil quality.  © 2022 	Article	Scopus

Improving its representation in land surface models is important to further understand the interactions between climate and bioenergy production, supporting accurate climate projections and decision-making. This study aimed to calibrate and evaluate the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) for climate impact assessments in sugarcane. A dataset composed of soil moisture, water and carbon fluxes and biomass measurements from field experiments across Brazil was used to calibrate and evaluate JULES-crop and JULES-BE parametrizations. The ability to predict the spatiotemporal variability of sugarcane yields and the impact of climate change was also tested at five Brazilian microregions. Parameters related to sugarcane allometry, crop growth and development were derived and tested for JULES-crop and JULES-BE, together with the response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, temperature and low-water availability (CTW-response). Both parametrizations showed comparable performance to other sugarcane dynamic models, with a root mean squared error of 6.75 and 6.05 t ha−1 for stalk dry matter for JULES-crop and JULES-BE, respectively. The parametrizations were also able to replicate the average yield patterns observed in the five microregions over 30 years when the yield gap factors were taken into account, with the correlation (r) between simulated and observed interannual variability of yields ranging from 0.33 to 0.56. An overall small positive trend was found in future yield projections of sugarcane using the new calibrations, with exception of the Jataí mesoregion which showed a clear negative trend for the SSP5 scenario from the years 2070 to 2100. Our simulations showed that an abrupt negative impact on sugarcane yields is expected if daytime temperatures above 35°C become more frequent. The newly calibrated version of JULES can be applied regionally and globally to help understand the interactions between climate and bioenergy production. © 2022 The Authors.

The experimental design was randomized complete blocks in a 4×2 factorial arrangement – four rates (150, 250, 350, and 450 g ha-1) × two sources (MnSO4.H2O and MnCO3) of Mn –, with four replicates. In the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 crop seasons, foliar fertilizations were carried out on the third trifoliate leaflet, and Mn content and soybean yield were evaluated. In both crop seasons, Mn foliar fertilization increased the contents of the nutrient in leaves, stems, and grains, but did not affect grain yield and dry matter production. The maximum Mn contents in leaves were obtained with rates between 150 and 450 g ha-1. The fertilization with MnSO4.H2O increased Mn uptake, transport, and redistribution in the plant, with a performance superior to that of MnCO3. Foliar fertilization with MnSO4.H2O in soybean, in a Cerrado soil, increases Mn contents in the leaves but not yield and dry matter production. © 2022, Pesquisa Agropecuária Brasileira.

The inputs for the PTF are the bottom flux criterium, the profile depth, and the retention and conductivity parameters of the Van Genuchten – Mualem model, VGM. A first polynomial was developed including all VGM parameters and a second polynomial considers VGM parameter l equal to 0.5, the most commonly applied value. The polynomials were built using stepwise multiple linear regression and a generated dataset over a wide range of VGM model parameters. The “observed values” for the polynomial calibration were acquired from internal drainage simulations performed by the Richards equation-based model SWAP. The derived polynomials predicted the simulated ΘFC with high accuracy. The RMSD between observed and predicted ΘFC on tested datasets, for the complete version and the l = 0.5 polynomial version were, respectively, 0.01912 and 0.01362. The proposed polynomials may be combined with other PTFs providing the VGM parameters from texture and/or other basic data. Examples of predicted FC water content and pF are shown on texture triangles using the Rosetta PTF to predict VGM parameters from soil texture data. For stand-alone use, the polynomials allow predicting the flux-based ΘFC from VGM parameters without the need for numerical simulations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Merrill) and maize (Zea mays (L.) seeds and their effect on seedling development. Two doses—2 and 4 mL kg−1 seeds—of a mixed copper, zinc, and molybdenum formulation were applied on both seed species, and process efficiency, i.e., how much of the applied solutions were transferred to the seeds, was determined. The spatial distribution of these nutrients was examined through microprobe X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and the effects on seed germination and seedling’s root and shoot development were recorded. Besides, the fraction of applied nutrients transferred from the seeds up to the seedlings tissues and the efficiency of the coating process were quantified. The results showed that seed treatments presented an overall efficiency of 70%. Most of the nutrients applied remained attached to the seed surface, i.e., seed coat or pericarp tissues in both species, being transferred to the soil afterwards. Only a tiny fraction of zinc, copper, and molybdenum was found in root and shoot tissues germinated from the coated seeds. The treatments did not impair seed germination or affected the content of the other mineral elements in the root and shoot tissues, although it had promoted a slight increase on maize’s root tissue length and dry mass. These results bring to light that the current seed treatment transfers part of the nutrients directly to the early developing seedling, while the remaining is precisely deposited in the soil volume where the root system will develop. © 2021, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.

It is particularly attractive in flow analysis in view of its highly reproducible reagent addition(s) and controlled timing. Then, measurements without attaining the steady state, kinetic discrimination, exploitation of unstable reagents and/or products, as well as strategies compliant with Green Analytical Chemistry, have been efficiently exploited. Flow-based chemical derivatization has been accomplished by different approaches, most involving flow and manifold programming. Solid-phase reagents, novel strategies for sample insertion and reagent addition, as well as to increase sample residence time have been also exploited. However, the required alterations in flow rates and/or manifold geometry may lead to spurious signals (e.g., Schlieren effect) resulting in distorted peaks and a noisy/drifty baseline. These anomalies can be circumvented by a proper flow system design. In this review, these aspects are critically discussed mostly in relation to spectrophotometric and luminometric detection. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	Review	Scopus

The isolation of viable protoplasts followed by regeneration of plants through somatic embryogenesis is an important methodology for breeding applications. The methods presented here can also be used as a reference for protoplast work in other species, followed by protocol optimization for different species/genotypes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Nevertheless, it has been frequently used as the upper limit for available water in bucket-type models. We aimed to find the value of FC in the bucket-type model WOFOST that best simulates the water balance predicted by the Richards equation-based model SWAP, here considered as a benchmark. With an equal description of plant growth, we calibrated FC in WOFOST by minimizing the root mean square deviation between selected outputs (targets) from WOFOST and SWAP. The calibrated FC value depended on the target, soil type, climate, and crop drought sensitivity. Using common soil-based values for FC, available water was underestimated up to 60%. Crop production parameters were insensitive to FC, and although best values for FC were close to saturation, crop production results were similar to employing a common pF value between 1.0 and 2.0. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The analytical method relies on the discoloration of an alkaline Eriochrome Black T (EBT) solution because of complex formation with the analytes. Ethanol was used as a mediator solvent for dissolving both biodiesel and EBT. The analytical response was based on the measurement of reflected radiation from digital images captured using a smartphone camera. Photometric measurements were based on the RGB color system, taken R channel values as the analytical signal because of complementarity with the color of the EBT solution. The coefficient of variation (n = 10) and limit of detection were 1.0% and 3 µmol L–1, respectively. A linear response was observed in the 10–75 µmol L–1 range, described by the equation R = 0.612C + 93.1 (r = 0.999). The reagent amounts consumed per determination were as little as 25 µg of EBT and 120 µg of NaOH, with generation of only 935 µL of waste. The procedure was selective for calcium and magnesium, without interference of metal ions (Na+, K+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+) as well as other sample components (glycerol, methanol, and water) in concentrations higher than those expected in biodiesel. Matrix effects for biodiesel obtained from different raw materials were negligible (recoveries from 90 to 104%), making feasible external standard calibration with aqueous/ethanolic reference solutions. The results agreed with those obtained by ICP OES after sample preparation by emulsion breaking, demonstrating the reliability of the proposed approach. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

AmDODA is encoded by the dodA gene, whose DNA sequence was inferred from cDNA and gDNA libraries almost 30 years ago. However, reports on its heterologous expression rely on either the original 5′-truncated cDNA plasmid or artificial gene synthesis. We provide unequivocal evidence that the heterologous expression of AmDODA from A. muscaria specimens is not possible by using the coding sequence previously inferred for dodA. Here, we rectify and reannotate the full-length coding sequence for AmDODA and express a 205-aa His-tagged active enzyme, which was used to produce the l-DOPA hygroaurin, a rare fungal pigment. Moreover, AmDODA and other isozymes from bacteria were submitted to de novo folding using deep learning algorithms, and their putative active sites were inferred and compared. The wide catalytic pocket of AmDODA and the presence of the His-His-His and His-His-Asp motifs can provide insight into the dual cleavage of l-DOPA at positions 2,3 and 4,5 as per the mechanism proposed for nonheme dioxygenases.  © 2022 The Authors.

In this study, we evaluated the diversity, structure, and composition of the PGPB community in Brazilian Cerrado with different types of physiognomies (Campo Graminoide, Cerrado stricto sensu, and Cerradao). There were no differences between the diversity and richness of the PGPB community among the three types of physiognomies. However, each physiognomy showed different composition and structure of the PGPB community that was driven by environmental conditions, mainly soil temperature, pH, moisture, and macronutrients. The PGPB community was dominated by Bacillus (36.2%), Alicyclobacillus (22.1%), Mycobacterium (12.2%), Paenibacillus (9.1%), Burkholderia (7%), Streptomyces (5.7%), Saccharopolyspora (1.7%), and Brevibacillus (1.4%) and Campo Graminoide presented a higher abundance of most PGPB genera. In addition, the interactions between PGPB were more complex in Cerradao (1411 edges) than other physiognomies. This study also showed that the PGPB community is well embedded within the whole bacterial community, revealing that these bacterial species are important drivers of the overall bacterial community in these soils. The findings of this study expand the knowledge about the PGPB community in Cerrado and add important information that can contribute to the further prospection of these bacterial species. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Among the procedures employed in the sample preparation for sulphonamide determination are liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) that use large volumes of organic solvents. Hence, a clean procedure was developed based on preconcentration and cloud point extraction (CPE) without using organic solvents to quantify total sulphonamides in bovine milk. The procedure was optimized as follows: 2 mL of pre-cleaned milk sample, 2 mL of reagent solution and 1 mL of Triton X-114 7% (m/v) were added to a tube, heated in a water bath at 40 °C for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 2950 rcf for 20 minutes. Digital image acquisition was employed directly at the tube without removing the supernatant/aqueous phase. The linear response was observed between 10 and 400 μg L−1 of total sulphonamides and described by the following equation: S = 2.50 + 0.0514C (μg L−1) and R = 0.999. The LOD and the CV (n = 11) were estimated to be 10 μg L−1 and 1.3%, respectively. The main interferents present at their usual concentrations in the sample did not interfere with the results. Spike and recovery tests of total sulphonamides were carried out in UHT and pasteurized milk with recovery values between 73 and 106% and the results obtained for this kind of sample were in agreement with those achieved by a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure at the 95% confidence level. The analytical procedure presents an adequate sensitivity to determine total sulphonamides in bovine milk and does not require organic solvents, being aligned to the principles of green chemistry. © The Royal Society of Chemistry	Article	Scopus

In soils cultivated with sugarcane, tillage and fertilization are management practices commonly carried out. Soil management practices alter the physical and chemical properties increasing or decreasing metal availability. The purpose of this study was to quantify soil metal concentrations during pasture-to-sugarcane conversion correlating these changes with physical and chemical properties. The results showed that the concentration of metals in soil samples occurred according to the following order Fe > Mn > Cr > Zn > Cu > Pb > Cd. Significant increases in soil metal concentrations due the sugarcane cultivation were observed to Cd and Cu. The soil physical and chemical properties presented correlations with soil metal concentrations. There was a strong relationship on inorganic fertilization to change in soil metal concentrations. The principal component analysis (PCA) explained 55.4% of the total data variance, separating factors in two groups that pointed to an influence of fertilization on metal grouping. Inorganic fertilizer application may input 1.06 g·ha–1·year–1 Cd. The Cd concentration ranged from 0.15 to 1.07 mg·kg–1, representing addictions of 9.54 mg·ha–1·year–1 Cd in soil. The metal concentrations observed after five years of pasture-to-sugarcane conversion did not represent environmental risks since the concentrations remained below the Brazilian official determinations. © 2022, Agronomic Institute of Campinas.

For comparison, we analysed the effects of inoculating Azospirillum brasilense Ab-V5, a strain that is commercialized as inoculant for maize, as well as the combinations RZ2MS16 + Ab-V5 and RZ2MS9 + Ab-V5. The treatment RZ2MS9 + Ab-V5 yielded the highest plant height and stalk diameter, which were significantly different from the non-inoculated control (p < 0.05). The core microbiome of maize was mainly composed of the bacterial classes Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Cytophagia, and Bacilli. Overall, the inoculation process had no effect either on the composition of the maize-associated bacterial community or on the total bacterial biomass. However, we detected significant differences in the richness and in the community structure among the plant niches analysed. Linear discriminant analysis identified that the class Actinobacteria, and the order Actinomycetales were enriched in leaf and root of plants treated with RZ2MS16 + Ab-V5 and in rhizosphere of plants treated with RZ2MS9 + Ab-V5. Functional analysis of the soil samples revealed significant differences in the abundance of predicted genes encoding proteins related to respiration and solubilization of Cu, Mg, and K among treatments. Furthermore, the NMDS ordination showed association between different functional gene categories and some plant traits. Our findings contribute to understanding the efficacy of microbial inoculants for maize in field conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

The effects of K supply on plant growth, nutritional status, leaf gas exchange parameters, leaf water potential (ψw), leaf area (LA), stomatal density (SD), leaf carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopic compositions (δ13C and δ15N ‰) and leaf C/N ratio under polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced water deficit were measured. Under both control (non-PEG) and osmotic stress (+PEG) conditions, K supply increased plant growth, boosting dry matter yield with decreased C/N leaf ratio and δ15N ‰ values. The +PEG significantly reduced LA, plant growth, dry matter yield, ψw, number of stomata per plant and leaf gas exchange, relative to non-PEG condition. Potassium supply alleviated osmotic-induced alterations in Eucalyptus seedlings by better regulating leaf development as well as SD, thus improving the rate of leaf gas exchange parameters, mesophyll conductance to CO2 (lower δ13C ‰ values) and water use efficiency (WUE). Consequently, K-supplied plants under drought better acclimated to osmotic stress than K-deficient plants, which in turn induced lower CO2 assimilation and dry matter yield, as well as higher leaf δ13C ‰ and δ15N ‰ values. In conclusion, management practices should seek to optimize K-nutrition to improve WUE, photosynthesis-related parameters and plant growth under water deficit conditions. © 2021 The Author(s).

The added economic value that these features bring to the product has boosted the use of non-designative tools for authentication purposes. In this work, the feasibility of implementing a traceability system for Arabica coffee by country of origin was investigated using quality attributes and supervised machine learning algorithms: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Random Tree (RT) and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO). We used an available database containing quality parameters for coffee beans produced in 15 countries, including the largest exporters and importers. Overall, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda had the highest coffee quality index (Total Cup Points). Differences between countries were found with 99% confidence using Robust Multivariate Data Science with original data and 98% accuracy using Bootstrapping resampling method and Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. The model obtained by RF provided the best classification accuracy. The most important attributes to discriminate Arabica coffee by country of origin, in descending order, were body, moisture, total cup points, cupper points, acidity, aftertaste, flavor, aroma, balance, sweetness and uniformity. The coffee variety proved to be a promising variable to increase accuracy and can be incorporated among the quality attributes for classification and grading of coffee beans. © 2022 Elisabete A.

In this research, the effect of pyrolysis temperature (650, 750, 850, and 950 °C) on the properties of biochar derived from eucalyptus wood and its influence on the sorption/desorption, leaching, and distribution of hexazinone in soil were evaluated. Sorption and desorption were investigated using the batch balance method, and experiments were conducted to assess hexazinone leaching (in glass columns) and distribution (in biometric flasks). The pyrolysis temperature of 950 °C increased (nitrogen + oxygen)/carbon and ash ratios and produced a biochar with greater sorption coefficient and less desorption coefficient of hexazinone. The pyrolysis temperature of 650 °C produced an aliphatic material, with less sorption and greater desorption. Biochars produced at pyrolysis temperatures of 850 and 950 °C completely prevented leaching of the herbicide in soil. The total hexazinone unavailable (mineralized + non-extracted residue) in the biochar system produced at pyrolysis temperatures of 850 °C (46%) and 950 °C (49%) was higher compared to that produced at 650 °C (33%) and 750 °C (42%). Despite this, the addition of biochar did not alter hexazinone mineralization but reduced the availability of the product in the environment due to the greater amount of non-extracted residue, thus reducing the risk of environmental contamination by this herbicide. © 2021, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

Rubber tree is a major crop in South American countries and SALB disease control strategies would benefit from the availability of genomic resources for the fungal pathogen. Here, we assembled and annotated the P. ulei genome. Shotgun sequencing was performed using second and third generation sequencing technologies. We present the first P. ulei high-quality genome assembly, the largest among Mycosphaerellaceae, with 93.8 Mbp, comprising 215 scaffolds, an N50 of 2.8 Mbp and a BUSCO gene completeness of 97.5%. We identified 12,745 protein-coding gene models in the P. ulei genome with 756 genes encoding secreted proteins and 113 genes encoding effector candidates. Most of the genome (80%) is composed of repetitive elements dominated by retrotransposons of the Gypsy superfamily. P.ulei has the largest genome size among Mycosphaerellaceae, with the highest TE content. In conclusion, we have established essential genomic resources for a wide range of studies on P. ulei and related species. © 2022, Brazilian Journal of Genetics. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

Liming is widely adopted in acidic soils in humid tropical regions planted with Eucalyptus to increase the availability of some nutrients and supply Ca and Mg. However, liming decreases the availability of some micronutrients, such as Cu and Zn, depending on the lime content. Copper and Zn fertilization for Eucalyptus is usually intended to replace the amount of micronutrients extracted after wood harvesting. However, few studies have been carried out to investigate the combined effects of lime and Cu plus Zn application on forest plantations in tropical soils. Here, the effects of these factors on soil chemical-attributes, as well as nutrition, and growth performance of Eucalyptus grandis plantations were evaluated on a medium-textured Ferralsol. The stem volume yield improved after liming, regardless of the rate of application, and after Cu plus Zn fertilization. Liming increased soil pH and Ca and Mg availability and reduced Cu and Zn availability. Overall, liming reduced soil Cu and Zn contents in the residual-fraction, while increasing the fraction bound to organic-matter. High contents of Cu and Zn were linked to the organic-matter fraction in the soil under the Eucalyptus plantation. Eucalyptus trees grown in soils amended with lime had higher values for leaf area index and leaf Ca and Mg concentrations but showed reduced Cu and Zn concentrations. The combined application of lime and Cu plus Zn improved Eucalyptus growth, with the higher contribution of lime compared to Cu and Zn. In conclusion, the combined application of lime and Cu plus Zn is a useful strategy to provide balanced nutrition and optimize stem volume yields. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

It belongs to a clade of TFs well known for their involvement in the regulation of the salicylic acid-dependent systemic acquired resistance. To investigate if this TGA TF plays a role in tomato fruit growth and maturation, we took advantage of the fruit-specific SlPPC2 promoter (PPC2pro) to target the expression of a SlTGA2.2-SRDX chimeric repressor in a developmental window restricted to early fruit growth and maturation. Here, we show that this SlTGA2.2-SRDX repressor alters early fruit development and metabolism, including chloroplast number and structure, considerably extends the time necessary to reach the mature green stage and slows down fruit ripening. RNA sequencing and plant hormone analyses reveal that PPC2pro:SlTGA2.2-SRDX fruits are maintained in an immature stage as long as PPC2pro is active, through early modifications of plant hormonal signaling and down-regulation of MADS-RIN and NAC-NOR ripening regulators. Once PPC2pro becomes inactive and therefore SlTGA2.2-SRDX expression is reduced, ripening can proceed, albeit at a slower pace than normal. Altogether, this work emphasizes the developmental continuum between fruit growth, maturation and ripening and provides a useful tool to alter and study the molecular bases of tomato fruit transition to ripening. © The Author(s) 2021.

Plant growth, leaf gas exchange parameters, water relations, oxidative stress (H2O2 and MDA content), chlorophyll concentration, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopic leaf composition (δ13C and δ15N) were analyzed. Drought tolerant E. urophylla and E. camaldulensis showed positive responses to the partial K substitution by Na, with similar dry mass yields, stomatal density and total stomatal pore area relative to the well K-supplied plants under both water conditions, suggesting that 50% of the K requirements is pressing for physiological functions that is poorly substituted by Na. Furthermore, E. urophylla and E. camaldulensis up-regulated leaf gas exchanges, leading to enhanced long-term water use efficiency (WUEL). Moreover, the partial K substitution by Na had no effects on plants H2O2, MDA, δ13C and δ15N, confirming that Na, to a certain extent, can effectively replace K in plants metabolism. Otherwise, the drought-sensitive E. saligna species was negatively affected by partial K replacement by Na, decreasing plants dry mass, even with up-regulated leaf gas exchange parameters. The exclusive Na-supplied plants showed K-deficient symptoms and lower growth, WUEL, and δ13C, besides higher Na accumulation, δ15N, H2O2 and MDA content. © 2021, The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

However, N2O emissions and NO3− leaching from fertilizer nitrogen (N) addition can jeopardize the sustainability of sugarcane production worldwide. One of the possible approaches to mitigating these N-loss pathways is the use of nitrification inhibitors such as dicyandiamide (DCD). However, the effects of DCD on the fate of fertilizer-derived N in soil pools and functional N genes (e.g., nitrifiers and denitrifiers) remain unclear. We performed a laboratory incubation study for 54 days to evaluate the influence of DCD and fertilizer N rate ((15NH4)2SO4 applied at 40, 80, 120, and 160 µg N g−1) on 15N transformation and abundance of total prokaryotes (16S rRNA), nitrifiers (ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB)), and denitrifiers (nirK and nosZ) in a tropical sandy soil amended with sugarcane residues. Especially for high N rates (120 and 160 µg N g−1), DCD not only increased the NH4+-15N recovery by inhibiting nitrification but also stimulated microbial immobilization. However, the nitrification inhibitor decreased N losses (i.e., unrecovered 15N). The abundance of total archaea and bacteria was unaffected by both the fertilizer N rate and DCD. While the abundance of AOB and nirK was suppressed by DCD, AOA and nosZ abundance increased, with the latter gene being the highest at 160 µg g−1. We conclude that DCD mitigates N losses from ammonium-based fertilizer by inhibiting NO3− production and changing nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms in sandy acidic soil. © 2021, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.

However, how the forest-to-pasture conversion impact soil bacterial diversity remains poorly understood, mainly in the Caatinga biome, the largest tropical dry forest of the world. Here, we hypothesized that forest-to-pasture conversion would shape the microbial community. Thus, the soil bacterial community was assessed using the 16S rRNA gene sequencing into the Illumina MiSeq platform. Then, we analyzed ecological patterns and correlated the bacterial community with environmental parameters in forest, and two distinct pastures areas, one less productive and another more productive. The variation in soil properties in pastures and forest influenced the structure and diversity of the bacterial community. Thus, the more productive pasture positively influenced the proportion of specialists and the co-occurrence network compared to the less productive pasture. Also, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were abundant under forest, while Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Chloroflexi were abundant under pastures. Also, the more productive pasture presented a higher bacterial diversity, which is important since that a more stable and connected bacterial community could benefit the agricultural environment and enhance plant performance, as can be observed by the highest network complexity in this pasture. Together, our findings elucidate a significant shift in soil bacterial communities as a consequence of forest-to-pasture conversion and bring important information for the development of preservation strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Geochemical modelling can help to identify present-days processes and to quantify formation rates if the system is sufficiently constrained. Here we used the PHREEQC model for this purpose, applying it to soil alkaline to acidic soil systems in the Nhecolândia area. A large amount of data was available, but scientific questions remained opened. We carried out a complementary field study to clarify a key point necessary for modelling, confirming the disconnection between two types of groundwater, perched, alkaline and deep, acidic. Our simulations showed that the observed soil system corresponds to the current biogeochemistry and that paleoclimatic genetic hypotheses are unnecessary. We found that the ridge soil formation rate ranges from 396 to 638 kg ha−1 y−1, depending on hypotheses. We showed that the downslope soils act as buffers to store labile species during the dry season, allowing alkalinity to be maintained from one year to the next. At least 125 y were necessary to obtain downslope alkaline lakes, and this alkaline nature can quickly disappear after changing drainage conditions. We explained how hyperacidic horizons (pH < 4) can neighbor alkaline horizons (pH > 10) with a sharp contact. When correctly informed, geochemical modelling appeared as an effective tool to answer questions about soil processes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

The basis of these studies has traditionally been the anatomical identification of the annual ring boundary. However, the structure of these annual rings has been sparsely explored for complementary physical and chemical wood traits. Here, we explore the relationships among wood density features and chemical elements (S, K, Ca, Mn) involved in the annual tree ring formation of 12 tropical tree species from non-flooded forest in the southern Amazon basin. Transverse wood sections were used for each species to determine: 1) macroscopic distinction (radial growth and wood density), 2) microscopic analyse of vessels, axial and ray parenchyma (anatomy) and 3) X-ray densitometry (physical) and X-ray fluorescence (chemical). For some species, the profiles of wood density, and Ca and Mn content showed intra- and inter-annual patterns that allowed to define and characterize the growth boundary of tree rings. Ca, K and S were mainly distributed in axial parenchyma cells, and around vessels, whereas, Mn was mainly distributed in fibres. Our results showed significant species-specific correlations between tree-ring width, density and concentrations of Ca, K and Mn.

In this study, 18 six months of age lambs were maintained for 34 days in individual pens divided into three treatments that included animals infected with HC and TC, and control (infection-free). Haematological, ruminal parameter and microbial nitrogen absorbed by pune derivatives, as well as enteric methane emission (CH4), were analysed, and the rumen microbial taxonomic and functional profile assessed by shotgun metagenomics. The analysis showed that total protein, albumin, urea, and butyrate level were lower in animals infected by both parasites, while HC infection also decreased the haemoglobin level. Both infected groups (TC and HC) increased the enteric methane emission (CH4). TC and HC infections increased the diversity and richness of functional microbial genes. Most alterations in the rumen microbiome composition of infected groups are associated with the suppression of microbes involved in microbial homeostasis maintenance and expansion of the archaeal community in the infected animals. Infection led to an increased abundance of nitrogen, amino acid, protein, and energy metabolism genes. Overall, TC and HC infection increased the enteric methane emission, negatively affected taxon's responsible for maintenance de rumen homeostasis and modulated some important genes related to protein and energy metabolism. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Residues of veterinary drugs and environmental contaminants in animal products can cause diseases and acute toxicity in organisms exposed to these substances. This study evaluated official monitoring data of veterinary drug residues from the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply in tissues of poultry and swine in the period between 2002 and 2014 to check for hidden patterns in the occurrence of six common drugs (Closantel, Diclazuril, Nicarbazin, Sulfaquinoxaline, Doxycycline and Sulfamethazinein). The analysis of data was performed by using two machine learning methods: decision tree and neural networks, in addition to visual evaluation through graphs and maps. Contamination rates were low, varying from 0 to 0.66%. A spatial distribution pattern of detections of substances by region was identified, but no pattern of temporal distribution was observed. Nevertless, regressions showed an increase in levels when these substances were detected, so monitoring should continue. However, the results show that the products monitored during the study period presented a low risk to public health. © 2022 Universidade Federal de Goias. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

The PGPR Bt strain RZ2MS9 is a multi-trait maize growth promoter. We obtained a stable mutant of RZ2MS9 labelled with green fluorescent protein (RZ2MS9-GFP). We demonstrated that the Bt RZ2MS9-GFP successfully colonizes maize's roots and leaves endophytically. We evaluated whether RZ2MS9 has an additive effect on plant growth promotion when co-inoculated with Azospirillum brasilense Ab-V5. The two strains combined enhanced maize's roots and shoots dry weight around 50% and 80%, respectively, when compared to the non-inoculated control. However, non-differences were observed comparing RZ2MS9 alone and when co-inoculated with Ab-V5, In addition, we used co-inoculation experiments in glass chambers to analyse the plant's volatile organic compounds (VOCs) production during the maize-RZ2MS9 and maize-RZ2MS9-Ab-V5 interaction. We found that the single and co-inoculation altered maize's VOCs emission profile, with an increase in the production of indoles in the co-inoculation. Collectively, these results increase our knowledge about the interaction between the Bt and maize, and provide a new possibility of combined application with the commercial inoculant A. brasilense Ab-V5. © 2021 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Since the elucidation of the gene silencing mechanism, RNAi became an important tool used in insect reverse genetics. The demonstration of effective target-gene silencing by ingestion of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced by transgenic plants indicated the RNAi potential to be used in insect pest management, particularly in agriculture. However, the efficiency of gene silencing by RNAi in insects may vary according to the target taxa, and lepidopteran species have been shown to be quite recalcitrant to RNAi. Developing transgenic plants is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, so alternative oral delivery systems are required to develop and optimize RNAi settings, such as selecting an efficient target gene, and dsRNA design, length, and stability, among other features. We have developed delivery systems to evaluate dsRNAs to silence genes from two important lepidopteran crop pests of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and sugarcane (Saccharum × officinarum): Tuta absoluta (Meyrick), the South American Tomato Pinworm, and Diatraea saccharalis (Fabricius), the Sugarcane Borer, respectively. The protocol described here can be used in similar species and includes (a) direct oral delivery by droplets containing dsRNA; (b) oral delivery by tomato leaflets that absorbed dsRNA solution; (c) delivery by Escherichia coli expressing dsRNA; and (d) delivery by transgenic plants expressing dsRNA. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

To date, water treatment systems have not been effective in removing or degrading these cyanotoxins. In this work, we investigated the inhibitory activity of surfactants on the growth of M. aeruginosa and their application to extract the intracellular produced cyanotoxins. The experiments involving growth inhibition and extraction of cyanotoxins were carried out using the non-biodegradable surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) in addition to other biodegradable surfactants. These were Tween 80 and surfactants derived from amino acids and peptides, respectively, from arginine, SDA, and hydrolyzed peptone, SDP. We demonstrated that the tested surfactants could be used to inhibit the growth of M. aeruginosa. At this point, CTAB and SDA proved to be the most competent surfactants in reducing cyanobacterial growth. Moreover, microcystins have been successfully removed from the water employing a cloud point extraction protocol based on the use of these surfactants and ammonium sulfate. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The lack or excess of circulating nutrients reaching the ovary can change its gene expression. A protein deficiency in the blood caused by an Haemonchus contortus abomasal infection is detrimental to the organism’s development during puberty. The peripubertal period is a time of intensive growth that requires a high level of nutrients. An essential feature controlling pubertal arousal and female reproductive potential is ovarian follicle growth activation. Protein supplementation improves the sheep’s immune response to helminthic infections. We aimed to determine if supplementing protein in infected ewe lambs’ diet would impact the ovarian environment leading to earlier ovarian follicle activation than in infected not supplemented animals. Methods: We fed 18 Santa Ines ewe lambs (Ovis aries) - bred by the same ram - with either 12% protein (Control groups) or 19% protein (Supplemented groups) in their diets. After 35 days of the diet, they were each artificially infected or not with 10,000 Haemonchus contortus L3 larvae. Following 77 days of the diet and 42 days of infection, we surgically collected their left ovaries and examined their genes expression through RNA sequencing. Results: We found that protein supplementation in infected animals led to an up-regulation of genes (FDR p-values < 0.05) and biological processes (p-value cut-off = 0.01) linked to meiotic activation in pre-ovulatory follicles and primordial follicle activation, among others. The supplemented not infected animals also up-regulated genes and processes linked to meiosis and others, such as circadian behaviour. The not supplemented animals had these same processes down-regulated while up-regulated processes related to tissue morphogenesis, inflammation and immune response. Conclusion: Diet’s protein supplementation of peripubertal infected animals allowed them to express genes related to a more mature ovarian follicle stage than their half-sisters that were not supplemented. These results could be modelling potential effects of the interaction between environmental factors, nutrition and infection on reproductive health. When ovarian activation is achieved in a timely fashion, the ewe may generate more lambs during its reproductive life, increasing sheep breeders’ productivity. © 2021, The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

We screened 40 endophytic fungi associated with Mexican shrimp plant (Justicia brandegeana) using an in vitro dual culture assay for Fusarium oxysporum, one of the most important phytopathogens of tomato plants. The three best antagonists, Colletotrichum siamense (JB224.g1), C. siamense (JB252.g1), and Diaporthe masirevicii (JB270), were identified based on multilocus sequence analysis. They were assessed in vitro for their inhibition of F. oxysporum and phosphate solubilisation capacity, and for the production of indole acetic acid. Greenhouse experiments verified the growth-promoting effects of these endophytes and the suppression of F. oxysporum symptoms in tomato plants.   Under greenhouse conditions, the JB252.g1 and JB270 isolates showed positive results for seedling emergence speed. The radicular system depth of plants inoculated with JB270 was greater than that in uninoculated plants (27.21 vs 21.95 cm). The soil plant analysis development chlorophyll metre (SPAD) index showed statistically significant results, especially for the endophyte JB224.g1 (36.99) compared to the control plants (30.90) and plants infected solely with F. oxysporum (33.64). © 2022 The Author(s).

Six treatments were used in randomized complete design in a 2×3 factorial arrangement with two levels of MON (0 and 2.08 mg/mL of buffered rumen fluid) and three levels of ENP (0, 1.5 and 3.0%). The substrate consisted of 50% Tifton-85 hay and 50% concentrate mixture (ground corn and soybean meal). ENP replaced soybean meal to achieve isonitrogenous diets (15% CP). No ENP×MON interaction was observed for any measured variable (P > 0.05) except for the relative abundance of F. succinogenes (P = 0.02) that linearly increased in diets with MON when ENP was added. The ENP addition decreased CH4 production (P < 0.01) without affecting (P > 0.05) truly degraded organic matter nor the relative abundance of methanogens. Hydrogen production was reduced with MON (P = 0.04) and linearly decreased with ENP inclusion (P = 0.02). We concluded that use of nitrate is a viable strategy for CH4 reduction, however, no additive effect of ENP and MON was observed for mitigating CH4 production. © 2022, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

K. Koch) is known to suffer from commercially important nickel deficiency manifested in “mouse-ear” disease. Foliar application of nickel has been shown to increase foliar nickel concentrations and foliar urease activity and to cure the nickel deficiency syndrome. However, there is currently no detailed knowledge on the uptake pathways of nickel into pecan leaves and subsequent internal redistribution of nickel after foliar application. In this study, we cultivated pecan seedlings for a period of 6 months after germination (growing to 250–350 mm tall with mature compound leaves) under low nickel availability in hydroponics solutions. The solution was purified to < 0.001 mg L−1 of nickel, and plants displayed severe “mouse-ear” deficiency symptoms. Half of the plants were then treated with a foliar nickel spray (100 mg L−1 nickel), and leaves were analysed using instrumental micro-X-ray fluorescence (µXRF) analysis, and total leaf nickel concentrations and urease activities were determined. The results show that nickel is rapidly taken up in the leaf and distributed into the vascular bundles. Application of nickel leads to a major increase in urease activity as well as in leaf nickel concentrations, and young emerging growth no longer display deficiency symptoms. The uptake pathway of nickel following foliar application is via the main vein into the secondary veins towards other tissues. © 2021, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.	Article	Scopus

We performed a palynotaxonomy study of pollen morphology and ultrasculpture of nine species of Aeschynomene and 13 species of Ctenodon using light, scanning and electron transmission microscopy, and provided novel data for seven species. Additionally, principal components analysis was performed to elucidate patterns of quantitative data variation between species. Pollen is isopolar (rarely apolar and pantocolporate), small to medium in size, oblate to prolate, 3-zonocolporate or 3-parassyncolporate/3-syncolporate (only in A. americana) with a colporus with margo (the margo was rarely absent), membrane or/and operculum (the operculum was rarely absent), and a rugulate-perforate or nanoreticulate to reticulate sexine. Two pollen types are recognised, one for each genus, based on ultrasculpture variation of the colporus operculum, membrane and margo, and the mesocolpium and apocolpium sexine combined with endoaperture features. The eurypalynous morphology supports the current circumscription of these genera and their phylogenetic relationships. © 2022 Collegium Palynologicum Scandinavicum.	Article	Scopus

In this study, we evaluated the effects of nutrient solutions deplete in B, Cu, or Zn on the nutrition, growth, and production of biochemical compounds in Eucalyptus urophylla cuttings. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse for 90 days, with clonal cuttings of E. urophylla at four months of age. The treatments evaluated were complete fertilization (CF) and individual omissions of B, Cu, and Zn in the nutrient solution. The omission of Cu and Zn increased the concentration of carbohydrates in the leaves by 10% and reduced the rate of CO2 assimilation (A) by more than 30%. Cu omission decreased the lignification process compared to complete fertilization. Flavonoid production in plants with complete fertilization was 45–75% higher than that in plants maintained under B, Cu, or Zn deficiencies. Collectively, these results suggest that micronutrient deficiencies may reduce plant productivity as well as plant resistance to pests and pathogens. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

However, efforts to describe these processes have not been well distributed across the basin. No study has yet investigated in depth tree mortality process in the unique low, open, bamboo-dominated forests of southwestern Amazonia, a region with a distinct climate and the epicenter of recent severe drought events. Here, we investigated the leading ways that trees die in the terra-firme forests of the southwestern Brazilian Amazon, to understand whether the dynamics of mortality differ from those recorded in other parts of the basin. Using data from six permanent plots located in southwestern Amazonia, we calculated the mortality rate for three main modes of tree death: standing, broken and uprooted. We thus identified the predominant mode of death over a 14 year period (2002–2016). We found that trees in the southwestern Amazon died mainly standing (325 trees, 0.8% year−1) and broken (362 trees, 0.8% year−1); significantly fewer trees died uprooted (156 trees, 0.4% year−1, equivalent to less than one in five of all trees dying). During the study period, the tree mode of death with the greatest proportion in the region alternated between standing and broken trees. Forest characteristics of the southwestern Amazon, like presence and high density of bamboo culms, and the fact that the region was subject to severe droughts in 2005 and 2010, may be affecting how trees die in southwestern Amazon. The presence of these factors makes the forest dynamics of the southwestern Amazon different from other regions of the Amazon basin. © 2022 The Authors	Article	Scopus

The volatile compounds from the crude extract were analysed by GC-MS which demonstrate that mellein and β-orcinaldehyde were are the major compounds. The best minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the extract was observed against Gram-positive bacteria, with a MIC of 15.6 μg/mL towards B. cereus and MIC of 62.5 μg/mL towards S. aureus and B. subtilis. MBC values of 31.25 μg/mL, 62.5 μg/mL, and 250 μg/mL were observed towards B. cereus, B. subtilis, and S. aureus, respectively. The cytotoxicity analyses showed CC50 of 115 μg/mL. The crude extract showed antioxidant activity by the DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays. Therefore, the extract of the endophytic fungus presented biotechnological potential as an antibacterial and antioxidant agent. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

In this chapter we present a detailed protocol of somatic embryogenesis induction from nucellar tissue and the use of an alternative method of callus sieving for culture synchronization and embryo production. This is a simple method which can also be evaluated for other species aiming at better culture efficiency and somatic embryo production. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

However, the influence of B-nutritional status on plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity of some plants remains unclear, especially in dicots with higher B requirement, such as coffee. This study investigated the effects of B-nutritional status on ATP hydrolysis of plasma membrane and nutrients uptake in coffee. Coffee seedlings were grown in substrate with six B levels (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 mg dm−3, as H3BO3) for 153 days and plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity was evaluated in the roots, as well as nutrient concentration and accumulation in leaf tissues and plant growth. The B nutritional status greatly influenced plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity in roots. At 1.0 mg dm−3, the ATPase hydrolysis activity was six times greater and H+ transport two times higher compared to the lowest level of 0.1 mg dm−3. The B supply increased significantly leaf concentrations of B, K, P, Mg, and Ca; nevertheless, accumulation of these nutrients did not vary in the leaves because leaf biomass decreased at high B levels. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Therefore, a novel, fast, and green analytical alternative for screening milk samples based on the protein and fat content is proposed herein. The procedure relies on the effect of ethanol in milk, which induces protein precipitation (chaotropic effect) and promotes fat extraction. The analytical measurements are based on the precipitated mass (protein content) and the amount of water needed to induce turbidity in the ethanolic extract (fat determination). The amount of water was determined by microtitration of the extract, giving values of (64 ± 5) μL for whole milk (3 % m/v fat) and (104 ± 5) μL for skim milk (1 % m/v fat), whereas the mass of precipitate (from 0.1036 ± 0.0072 to 0.1134 ± 0.0068 g) did not differ significantly for these milk types because the protein content is standardized to ca. 3.0 % m/v. Quality control charts were used for sample screening, achieving specificity and sensitivity rates of 100 % for fat and 100 % and 75 % for protein, respectively. Ethanol (800 μL of 92.8 % v/v solution per determination) was the only reagent needed, demonstrating the environmental friendliness of the approach. The proposed procedure is suitable for fast and cost-effective screening of milk samples, with the aim of detecting non-conformities in the most important quality parameters of bovine milk at different stages of the production chain. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

For this reason, low cost methods are needed to detect such process in the field. In the present paper, we present a simple surface runoff detector made of polypropylene. Its low cost along with its high repeatibility allow for the use of a high number of detectors in the field to elucidate spatial variability as well as to trace overland flow route. Simple demonstrations of the method are provided. With this simple detector, more knowledge can be obtained on this important hydrologic pathway which is related to soil erosion and transport of a number of potential harmful substances to water bodies. © 2022, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

Here, we investigate processes that allow UF to gain and maintain such extraordinary carbon stocks. Using the International Soil Research and Information Center database, complemented with recently published datasets, we show that the carbon saturation capacity of the clay + silt fractions in UF (22.8 ± 5.7 g C kg−1 soil, n = 59) does not exceed the carbon saturation capacity in other ferralsols (23.3 ± 6.2 g C kg−1 soil, n = 165), thus eliminating a particularly retentive mineral matrix as a possible explanation. Rather, carbon stocks were correlated with the thickness of A horizons (106 ± 49 cm, n = 59 in umbric versus 35 ± 22 cm, n = 165 in non-umbric ferralsols). We subsequently hypothesized that differences in A-horizon thickness arose from two pedogenic scenarios: (i) superior carbon accrual resulting from a unique vegetation cover capable of allocating large quantities of carbon to belowground plant organs; and (ii) geomorphic processes that led to carbon burial. We evaluated the plausibility of these scenarios considering landscape history and associated carbon flux rates, hillslope position, as well as δ13C values and Ti/Zr ratios for subsets of ferralsol profiles studied by us in a region that encompasses latitudes from 26 to 7°S in eastern Brazil. We found that exceptional carbon stocks were most prevalent in the gradual transition zone (ecotone) between savanna and rainforest, likely resulting from erosion–deposition processes, historic changes of vegetation cover composed of grasses and arboreal elements, and active bioturbation. We suggest that attempts to sequester carbon in non-umbric ferralsols will be most successful if they emulate or promote the biotic and abiotic processes prevalent in the savanna/rainforest ecotone. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

It additionally faces the massive challenge of providing food for 10 billion people by 2050, despite increasing environmental deterioration. One way to better plan production in the face of current and continuing climate change is to better understand how our domestication of these crops included their adaptation to environments that were highly distinct from those of their centre of origin. There are many prominent examples of this, including the development of temperate Zea mays (maize) and the alteration of day-length requirements in Solanum tuberosum (potato). Despite the pre-eminence of some 15 crops, more than 50 000 species are edible, with 7000 of these considered semi-cultivated. Opportunities afforded by next-generation sequencing technologies alongside other methods, including metabolomics and high-throughput phenotyping, are starting to contribute to a better characterization of a handful of these species. Moreover, the first examples of de novo domestication have appeared, whereby key target genes are modified in a wild species in order to confer predictable traits of agronomic value.

The empirical nature of the FRF was contrasted to few calibrations reported in the literature, and the conditions where the correct operation of the FRF was of limited importance were discussed. Some alerts regarding the feasibility of this function in hydrological studies were provided and reinforced by a case study with sugarcane under subtropical conditions. Available modifications of the FRF can improve RWU predictions under aeration stress but some conceptual imperfections make it inaccurate under drought stress and high compensated uptake. In such cases, the use of mechanistic RWU models in replacement of the FRF is recommended to accurately predict the actual transpiration dynamics. The calibration of the FRF by inverse modeling is feasible, although some of the FRF parameters are insensitive to model outputs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Review	Scopus

Recently, a ‘rapid ecosystem function assessment’ (REFA) for measuring ecosystem functions has been proposed and tested as a suitable method. Thus, this study aimed to assess the proxies of ecosystem functions of three physiognomies of Cerrado through REFA. This method was applied in three different preserved physiognomies of Cerrado from Northeastern, Brazil, namely: Campo Graminoide (CG), Cerrado Stricto Sensu (CSS), and Cerradão (CD). All proxies for the selected ecosystem functions differed between sites and seasons. The above-and belowground primary productivity and microbial biomass C were higher in CD than in CSS and CG. The above-and belowground secondary productivity and decomposition were higher and similar in CD and CSS as compared to CG. The principal component analysis explained 89.8% of the data variation and clustered the majority of ecosystem functions with CD, in both seasons and CSS in the wet season. The proxies of ecosystem functions measured through REFA showed differences between the physiognomies of Cerrado. Since each physiognomy of Cerrado presents different plant richness and diversity, and soil conditions, these characteristics contribute to influencing multiple ecosystem functions. © 2022, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

These strains were cultured and characterized based on their morphology, molecular, and ultrastructural data. The two taxa were identified mainly by 16S rRNA gene phylogeny and 16S-23S ITS secondary structures since their morphology is similar to members of Leptolyngbya senso lato. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that our strains belong to Euryhalinema genus (Leptolyngbyaceae), with one strain close to type species E. mangrovii AP9F (MK402979), and the other described as a new species, E. epiphyticum sp. nov. Morphologically, both strains form green mats, had trichomes without sheath, and their thylakoid disposition is the same as described for Leptolyngbyaceae. The secondary structures Box B and D1-D1' of the internal transcribed spacer (16S-23S ITS) also corroborated our proposal of the new species E. epiphyticum. These findings constitute the first description of a new-to-science species for this genus outside Indian marine environments. Also, it expands the knowledge on Euryhalinema systematic.  © 2022 Magnolia Press.	Article	Scopus

Within them, ecosystem services provided by wildlife, such as pest insect suppression, may decrease or even be lost leading to a substantial increase in agricultural production costs. Pest insect suppression by bats has been identified as an essential ecosystem service but remains poorly investigated. For example, we still lack a basic understanding of the proportion of pest insects that comprises the diet of many bat species. Here, we explored the diet composition of eight Brazilian bat species (78 individuals) in a human-modified landscape through the analysis of stable carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) isotopes. Bats were categorised into guilds: open-space aerial insectivores, narrow-space gleaning frugivores, or narrow-space gleaning nectarivores. We divided the insects collected into three groups depending on their 13C values: forest, mixed, and pest insects. We found that open-space insectivorous bats had the highest proportion of insects in total in their diet - consuming primarily from the forest group (56%) and the pest group (34%). Interestingly, narrow-space gleaning frugivores also consumed pest insects (almost 20%). The narrow-space gleaning nectarivores had traces of insects in their diet, yet the actual proportion was inconclusive. Even though bats were from different guilds, with diets consisting mainly of plants and insects, the 15N indicated that they fitted to similar trophic levels, as secondary consumers. Therefore, the trophic level of nectarivorous and frugivorous bats showed a more generalist diet than previously assumed. The proportion of forest insects in the diet of open-space aerial insectivores may indicate the importance of small forest patches as food resources for wildlife such as the ones included in human-modified landscapes. The bats' contribution to this ecosystem service could improve the economic conservation value of Neotropical bats in human-modified landscapes.  © Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.	Article	Scopus

The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of potentially toxic cyanobacteria and the environmental conditions associated with the presence of cyanotoxins in a Brazilian subtropical reservoir. Five collections were carried out at seven sampling locations in the reservoir, during the rainy and dry seasons, between the years 2016 and 2017. There was permanent occurrence of Raphidiopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Aguilera, Berrendero Gómez, Kastovsky, Echenique & Salerno (Phycologia 57(2):130–146, 2018), ranging between dominant and abundant, with an average biomass of 38.8 ± 29.9 mg L−1. Also abundant were Dolichospermum solitarium, D. planctonicum, Planktothrix isothrix, and Aphanizomenon gracile. Saxitoxin (STX) was detected in all the collected samples (0.11 ± 0.05 µg L−1). Microcystin (MC) was also detected, but at lower concentrations (0.01 ± 0.0 µg L−1). Low availability of NO3− and phosphorus limitation had significant effects on the R. raciborskii biomass and the levels of STX and MC. It was observed that R. raciborskii was sensitive to thermal stratification, at the same time that STX levels were higher. This suggested that STX was produced under conditions that restricted the growth of R. raciborskii. These are important findings, because they add information about the permanent occurrence of STX and R. raciborskii in an aquatic ecosystem limited by phosphorus, vulnerable to climatic variations, and polluted by domestic effluents. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

However, the basic knowledge about the effects of soil properties on pXRF spectra are still poorly studied, which may lead users to biased interpretations of mathematical models. The present study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of moisture, soil organic matter content (SOM), and iron forms on pXRF data. The work was conducted with seventeen soil samples from the central region of São Paulo state (Brazil). Three selective dissolution treatments were applied to remove: (i) soil organic matter (−SOM), ii) SOM and poorly crystalline iron forms (−o), iii) SOM and poorly crystalline plus well crystalline iron forms (−d). One additional treatment iv) including water addition (+W) was also carried out. The effects of treatments were evaluated for sandy and clayey samples. Soil particle size distribution and elemental content affected the bremsstrahlung and characteristic peaks counts. In +W, there was a generalized decrease in counts mainly for the light elements (magnesium, aluminum and silicon). Regarding the selective dissolution procedures, alterations were verified, reflecting mainly the removal power of reagents. Generally, the most pronounced alterations occurred for −d and moderate alterations for −SOM and −o. The pXRF data showed high correlation with particle size distribution and mineralogy attributes. The kaolinite, gibbsite, Fe2O3, Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and MnO contents were quantified with satisfactory accuracy (0.61 < R2 < 0.97). The pXRF was able to detect changes caused by the selective dissolution treatments and soil particle size distribution. Sources of uncertainty, mainly soil moisture, must be considered. The understanding of the fundamentals of energy interaction with the sample matrix in the X-ray range is the starting point for characterizing the soil through pXRF. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The main objective was to investigate the relationship between livelihood conditions and the agro-food transition process in rural communities of the Center-West, Northeast, and Amazon regions of Brazil. We hypothesized that traditional agroecosystems and local food habits changed with greater access to market economies. The study was conducted with semi-structured questionnaire interviews to verify agro-food patterns, subsistence farming, natural resource use, and socioeconomic conditions. Moreover, we used stable isotope ratios from the inhabitants’ fingernails to determine the food source and trophic chain diversity. Data from questionnaires were analyzed using a Bayesian clustering model to characterize the socioeconomic conditions and agro-food patterns among rural and urban communities. The isotopic data were appraised through a nonparametric model to assess food differences among Brazilian regions and different community types. The Bayesian model allowed us to determine the optimal number of groups according to descriptive socioeconomic and agro-food variables sorted by each specific location. We also verified a food change from C3 (more natural) to C4 (more processed) with an increase in δ13C and a decrease in δ15N in the city and town localities. This indicates a livelihood shift from locally produced foods to processed items toward urban areas. Although remote villages showed more maintenance of their agro-food systems, increased access to market economies and the supermarket diet is changing the livelihood conditions of rural communities, which can compromise their traditional farming and food sovereignty. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

This study aimed to quantify the organic carbon (C) content of light SOM fractions at sites under pasture, native forest, or NT for different periods and assess the influence of management systems on C and nitrogen (N) stocks and C/N ratio in a Ferralsol in Paraná State, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from the 0–5, 5–10, 10–20, 20–30, 30–40, 40–50, and 50–60 cm layers at sites managed under NT for 6, 14, or 22 years (NT6, NT14, and NT22, respectively); a site under NT management for 12 years, followed by 4 years of Brachiaria intercropping (NT12 + B); a permanent pasture (PP); and a native forest (NF) site. A density fractionation was carried in 0–5 and 5–10 cm layers and then were obtained the organic C contents in fLF (fLF-C) and oLF (oLF-C). The stocks of fLF-C, oLF-C and total C stocks in the light fraction were then calculated. It was also determined the natural abundance of 13C and 15N and the contents of C and N were used to calculate the C/N ratio of each layer. Management systems promoted changes in C dynamics in light SOM fractions, δ13C, δ15N, and C/N ratio. Differences in 13C isotopic composition were observed only at depths greater than 30 cm, with the NF site differing from the others (− 25‰ δ13C). For NT6, NT14, NT22, NT12 + B, and NF, δ15N values indicated isotopic enrichment with depth. At the PP site, there was a decrease in isotopic enrichment with depth, ranging from just over 12‰ δ15N in topsoil to 10‰ δ15N in the 60 cm layer. Multivariate analyses were used to group sites according to the analyzed variables. In the 0–5 cm layer, PP soil was associated with 15N isotopic composition, whereas NT6, NT14, NT22, and NT12 + B had a strong correlation with C/N ratio. NF showed a strong association with C contents and stocks in light fractions. In the 5–10 cm layer, PP had a strong correlation with δ13C and C/N ratio. For NF soil, there was a correlation with light fraction C stock, free light fraction C content and stock, and δ15N isotopic composition. In contrast to the other management systems, NT12 + B was strongly correlated with occluded light fraction C content and stock in the 5–10 cm layer. These results underscore the importance of evaluating labile SOM fractions when assessing the quality of anthropized environments and how management practices adopted over time can affect the SOM light fraction dynamics. The introduction of other crops, such as Brachiaria, during the production cycle becomes a solution for increasing C stocks in cultivated soils. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The presence of straw in tropical cropping systems can affect herbicide transposition to the underlying seed banks and their environmental behavior. The aim of this study was to evaluate propisochlor soil retention in the presence of soybean and sugarcane straw (0, 5 and 10 t ha−1) through radiometric techniques. Most of the applied 14C-propisochlor was retained in the soil profile (18.2–39.4%) following an extreme rainfall simulation in the presence of straw. Decreased herbicide leaching was observed in the presence of sugarcane and soybean straw (0.7–0.5%), compared with soil without straw (1.8%). Hysteresis values ranged from 0.8 to 1.0, indicating that propisochlor sorption was reversible allowing for soil seed bank effects, as well as environmental dissipation. These findings indicate that propisochlor can overcome straw barriers, although representing low groundwater contamination risks. Because of this, reduced environmental impacts following the application of this herbicide are noted for tropical cropping systems containing straw mulch. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

However, knowledge gaps remain concerning elemental composition, localization, and interactions in Brazil nuts. This study presents a detailed assessment regarding the concentration and localization of relevant elements in Brazil nuts using different and complementary spectroanalytical techniques. Samples were collected from six sites of the Brazilian Amazon (Acre, Rondônia, Amazonas, Roraima, Pará, and Amapá) and showed results for selenium (Se) concentration ranging from 0.46 to 356 μg g−1 and barium (Ba) from 12.5 to 7,177 μg g−1. Then, a linear regression model fitted between Se and Ba concentration in Brazil nuts provided an R2 = 0.30. The spatial distribution of major and trace elements in Brazil nuts varied depending on the site of origin and concentration in the sample. The 2D maps performed via μ-XRF showed that Se accumulates mainly in the outer parenchyma tissue of Brazil nuts seeds forming a “ring” shape while Ba tends to accumulate in the epidermal tissue. The possibility of forming compounds of low solubility in Brazil nuts such as BaSO4 and BaSeO4 tends to increase when Ba and Se are higher respectively in the samples studied. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The Sphaerospermopsis aphanizomenoides strain BCCUSP55 was previously isolated from a water supply reservoir in the Brazilian semiarid region, and its draft genome assembly coupled with the gene contents are reported here. The obtained BCCUSP55 draft genome comprised 254 scaffolds with a genome size estimated of 6,096,273 bp. In addition, it has 5250 predicted coding sequences (CDS) and the G + C content is 38.5%. Further, the BCCUSP55 draft genome presented the putative nocuolin A gene complete cluster, a natural oxadiazine that triggers apoptosis in human cancer cells. Thus, our results contribute to extend the knowledge on the genus Sphaerospermopsis and reveal its biotechnological potential. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of gamma radiation doses under successive generations of cultivation on seed quality of two soybean lines (VX04-6828 and VX04-5692). Different gamma-ray doses (60Co) were evaluated (0; 50; 150 and 250 Gray) in the M0 (first sowing) generation, and analyzed for water content, germination, vigor, abnormal seedlings, dead seeds, and hilum color. Then, sowing (M0) was carried out to obtain plants and seeds of the first production cycle (M1 generation), and then those of the subsequent cycle (M2 generation). The same analyses of M0 were performed for M2 and M3 generations, with the addition of germination rate and emergence speed index in the field. The data were submitted to analysis of variance in a factorial arrangement. The generations were compared using Tukey's test, while doses were evaluated by regression analysis. Seeds of the two soybean lines showed significant interaction for the different generations and gamma-ray doses in all the variables analyzed, except for water content. The application of gamma rays in soybean seeds showed effects on successive generations of cultivation, with better physiological quality up to the dose of 150 Gy (Gray) and greater sensitivity to gamma radiation for the VX04-5692 line. © 2022 Universidad de Concepcion.

The feasibility of the proposed luminometer for signal transduction was ascertained using a light-emitting diode (LED) to simulate chemiluminescence emissions. The feasibility for analytical purposes was evaluated using the oxidizing reaction of luminol with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by hexacyanoferrate(III) inion in alkaline medium. The system that handles sample and reagent solutions is based on the multicommuted flow analysis (MCFA) approach. It uses solenoid mini-pumps and peristaltic mini-pumps controlled by an Arduino Due board for fluid propulsion. After optimizing the operational conditions, peroxide samples (pharmaceutical formulation) were analyzed. The accuracy was assessed by comparing the results with those obtained using a reference method. The results of a paired t-test at the 95% confidence level demonstrate no significant difference between the results. Other favorable characteristics of our method include: a linear response between 1 and 100 μmol L−1 hydrogen peroxide (r2 = 0.999); limit of detection and limit of quantification of 0.13 and 0.43 µmol L−1 H2O2, respectively; luminol and hexacyanoferrate(III) inion consumption of 60 µg (0.3 µmol L−1) and 1.9 mg (6 µmol L−1) per determination, respectively; a sampling rate of 230 determinations per hour; waste generation of 0.63 mL per determination; and a coefficient variation of 1.5% (n = 11) for a 0.17 mg L−1 (5 µmol L−1) hydrogen peroxide solution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

More recently, impetus has been given to assess the potential antiparasitic activity of less conventional resources, represented by different agro-industrial by-products (AIBPs). This review presents in vitro and in vivo results obtained with a range of tannin-containing AIBPs of various geographical and botanical origins, namely AIBP of nuts, temperate and tropical barks, carob, coffee and cocoa. They tend to confirm the ""proof of concept""for their antiparasitic effects and also for other aspects of ruminant production in an agro-ecological context. Socio-economic aspects of the exploitation of such non-conventional resources are also discussed as potential models of the circular economy, by using waste. The different modes of use of these resources are presented in this review, as well as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analyses to illustrate the advantages and limitations of on-farm use.  © "	Article	Scopus

To understand the effects induced by these nanoparticles, it is necessary to assess the environmental risk and safely expand their use. In this study, we evaluated the toxicity of copper oxide (nCuO) nanoparticles in Danio rerio adults, their distribution/concentration, and chemical form after exposure. This last assessment had never been performed on copper-exposed zebrafish. Such evaluation was done through the characterization of nCuO, acute exposure tests and analysis of distribution and concentration by microstructure X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (µ-XRF) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS). Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was performed to find out the chemical form of copper in hotspots. The results show that the toxicity values of fish exposed to nCuO were 2.4 mg L−1 (25 nm), 12.36 mg L−1 (40 nm), 149.03 mg L−1 (80 nm) and 0.62 mg L−1 (CuSO4, used as a positive control). The total copper found in the fish was in the order of mg kg-1 and it was not directly proportional to the exposure concentration; most of the copper was concentrated in the gastric system. However, despite the existence of copper hotspots, chemical transformation of CuO into other compounds was not detected. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.	Article	Scopus

A new low field nuclear magnetic resonance approach based on decay due to diffusion in internal magnetic field (NMR-DDIF) was successfully used to determine biochar's porosity and specific surface area (SSA) to clear the findings of this work. SSA of pores with diameters >5.0 μm increased with pyrolysis temperatures and seemed to dictate biochar's retention, which was >70% of the applied amounts at 650 °C. These macropores appear to act as main arteries for herbicide intra-particle diffusion into smaller pores, thus enhancing herbicides retention. Biochar granulometry had little, but herbicide aging had a significant effect on sorption, mainly of tebuthiuron. However, soils amended with 10,000 kg ha−1 of the biochars showed low sorption potential. Therefore, higher than usual biochar rates or proper incorporation strategies, i.e., surface incorporation, will be needed to remediate areas contaminated with these highly mobile herbicides, thus precluding their leaching to groundwaters. © 2021	Article	Scopus

It is used as patches and powders, and it could be further processed via enzymatic digestion under acidic conditions using pepsin. However, part of the bioactivity is lost during the digestion process due to protein denaturation. Here, stepwise digestion was developed to prepare a competent biomaterial for osteogenesis from three different ECM sources. In addition, three different proteases were compared to evaluate the most effective digestion protocol for specific cellular processes. GAGs and peptide quantification showed that the stepwise method yielded a higher concentration of bioactive residues. Circular dichroism analysis also showed that the stepwise approach preserved the secondary structures better. The protein profiles of the digested ECMs were analyzed, and it was found to be highly diverse and tissue-specific. The digestion of ECM from pericardium produced peptides originated from 94 different proteins, followed by 48 proteins in ECM from tendon and 35 proteins in ECM from bone. In addition, digested products from pericardium ECM yielded increased proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to mature osteoblasts. © 2022 Gabriela M.

However, in sugarcane fields, it is a difficult to control weed due to its rapid adaptation and growth mechanisms. It competes with sugarcane plants negatively affecting crop yield. Bermudagrass has polyploidy and easy hybridization, which promote high polymorphism, generating varying responses to the environment. Consequently, understanding the structure and variability of Bermudagrass becomes important for the development of strategies for its management as a weed. We examined the levels of genetic variability and structure of five populations (SP1 to SP5) of Bermudagrass, collected from sugarcane fields in the state of São Paulo (Brazil). Thirteen microsatellites were used. PCoA demonstrated STRUCTURE results (K=4) showing a mixture of SP1 and SP3 populations, with SP2, SP4 and SP5 being the most distant. DAPC also confirmed low genetic differentiation for SP1 and SP3. Genetic variability was found to be greater among than within populations, due to the predominance of vegetative growth of the species, which promotes low diversity, and due to geographic distances, which reduce gene flow or even make it unfeasible. The SSRs showed high resolution in characterizing the genetic diversity and structure of the five populations of Bermudagrass. The findings of this study may help to establish biological control methods against Bermudagrass in sugarcane fields. © FUNPEC-RP.	Article	Scopus

In this study we evaluated i) if possible Cd accumulation in the basal node compromises the growth of Brachiaria decumbens; ii) the role of nodes in Cd and nutrient accumulation and distribution in leaves; and iii) the relationship between Cd-induced nutritional disorders and photosynthetic impairment. B. decumbens cv. Basilisk was grown for two periods in an Oxisol presenting 0.02 (control), 2.28, 5.17 and 11.23 mg kg−1 soil with bioavailable Cd. The tillering of B. decumbens was not compromised, despite the basal node presenting high Cd concentrations, although Cd did induce stem shortening, especially in the regrowth period. Nodes restricted Cd upward transportation in the initial growth period, but Cd reached the upper nodes in the regrowth period. This result did not affect nutrient distribution into the aerial tissues of the grass. However, nutritional disorders induced by Cd appeared in the lower plant parts (especially in the growth period) due to Cd absorption by the basal node. The only effect of Cd-induced impairment on photosynthesis of B. decumbens was a reduction in instantaneous and intrinsic water use efficiency in leaf III (older), which presented higher Cd concentrations than leaves I and II (newer). In addition to the Cd effect, photosynthetic activity decreased in the regrowth period, probably in response to the lower ambient temperature in this period compared to the growth period. The nodes of B. decumbens keep Cd accumulated in the lower plant parts and avoid nutritional disorders and photosynthesis impairment in the plant leaves allowing for growth and biomass yield. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

A study was conducted to (1) evaluate Cd accumulation by rice cultivars, grown in Cd-polluted Tropical Oxisols, with different levels of Cd tolerance; (2) quantify Cd transfer from soil to rice shoots and grain; and (3) estimate daily Cd intake by humans. Three rice cultivars, characterized by low (Cateto Seda–CS), medium (BRSMG Talento–BT), and high (BRSMG Caravera–BC) Cd uptake capacity, were investigated. Rice cultivars were exposed to increasing soil Cd concentrations (0.0, 0.7, 1.3, 3.9, 7.8, and 11.7 mg kg−1). Analysis was performed on soil, shoots, and grain. Shoot biomass and grain yield decreased with increasing Cd supply, suggesting the following Cd tolerance: CS > BT > BC. Cadmium concentrations in shoots and grain increased when exposed to Cd. Only CS did not exceed the maximum Cd limit permitted in food (0.40 mg kg−1), when rates up to 1.3 mg kg−1 of Cd were applied to soil. Considering daily rice consumption levels in Brazil, Cd intake often exceeds maximum tolerable levels. Continuous monitoring of soil Cd concentrations is a pivotal step in avoiding hazards to humans. Such monitoring is important on a global scale since outside of Asia, Brazil is the leading rice-producing and rice-consuming country.

In this study, the morphological and yield characteristics of forage cactus cultivars were evaluated for some soil-based irrigation management criteria. Five experiments were carried out simultaneously under semiarid conditions in a randomized block design, with forage cactus cultivars Orelha de Elefante (OE), IPA-Sertânia (IPA), Doce (DC), Gigante (GG), and Orelha de Onça (OO). For each cultivar, irrigation management was performed using four upper thresholds of matric potential (−0.2, −0.33, −1, and −3 atm), as well as a non-irrigated (rainfed) treatment. Forage cactus crop yield was evaluated after 12 months and responded positively and similarly to irrigation management using any of the thresholds, with a significant increase in the cladode area and, overall, a positive effect on growth and yield parameters. Very high irrigation water productivity up to 75 kg m−3 was obtained especially in the −3 atm threshold treatment, whereas an increase of the threshold potential caused a sharp reduction of water productivity. We conclude that irrigation management of forage cactus grown in semi-arid climates is highly beneficial and that unconventionally low matric potential thresholds may be used. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

We also investigated the temporal variation in nitrogen transfer to a cherry tomato, the biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) of legumes, and the N concentration of green corn cultivated in the intercrop succession. The experimental design was a complete randomized block with eight treatments and five replications, described as follows: Two controls consisting of a monocrop of cherry tomato with or without residual straw, cherry tomato and jack bean, sun hemp, dwarf velvet bean, mung bean, and white lupine or cowpea bean in intercropping system. The BNF was responsible for more than half of the N accumulated in the legumes. The N of legumes was transferred to cherry tomato in similar quantities, and the leaves and fruits of cherry tomato received more N transfer than shoots. It was shown that N transfer increases with the growth/development of cherry tomatoes. The intercropping system with legumes did not affect the 15N natural abundance of leaves and the aboveground biomass of green corn cultivated in succession. © 2021 by the authors.	Article	Scopus

However, there is still a growing need for bioscientists, from different backgrounds, with different levels, to acquire programming skills, which could reduce the time from data to insights and bridge communication between life scientists and computer scientists. Python is a programming language extensively used in bioinformatics and data science, which is particularly suitable for beginners. Here, we describe the conception, organization, and implementation of the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data. This workshop has been organized by graduate and undergraduate students and supported, mostly in administrative matters, by experienced faculty members since 2017. The workshop was conceived for teaching bioscientists, mainly students in Brazil, on how to program in a biological context. The goal of this article was to share our experience with the 2020 edition of the workshop in its virtual format due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic and to compare and contrast this year's experience with the previous in-person editions. We described a hands-on and live coding workshop model for teaching introductory Python programming. We also highlighted the adaptations made from in-person to online format in 2020, the participants' assessment of learning progression, and general workshop management. Lastly, we provided a summary and reflections from our personal experiences from the workshops of the last 4 years. Our takeaways included the benefits of the learning from learners' feedback (LLF) that allowed us to improve the workshop in real time, in the short, and likely in the long term. We concluded that the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data is a highly effective workshop model for teaching a programming language that allows bioscientists to go beyond an initial exploration of programming skills for data analysis in the medium to long term.

Long periods of exposure to sulfonamides may cause adverse effects such as heart problems, allergic reactions, and hepatic and digestive dysfunction in humans. The maximum residue limit established for the total quantity of sulfamethazine, sulfadimethoxine, and sulfathiazole in bovine milk is 100 μg L−1. This study aims to employ dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME) as a green chemistry technique for the extraction of total sulfonamides in bovine milk samples. The procedure involves the formation of an imino salt, posterior DLLME with 1-butanol, and measurement using digital images. A linear response was observed between 50 and 1000 µg L−1 for total sulfonamides, described by the equation: Analytical signal = 3.02 + 0.03 C (µg L−1) (R2 = 0.999). The coefficient of variation (n = 11; 250 µg L−1 total sulfonamides) and the detection limit were estimated to be 0.49% and 20 µg L−1, respectively. For 0.50 mL of milk sample, 0.75 mg p-DAC, 17.30 mg SDS, 49.20 mg of trichloroacetic acid, and 0.50 mL 1-butanol were consumed. Recovery tests using the addition-recuperation method were performed, achieving 88 and 100% recovery. The results agreed with those obtained by a HPLC procedure at 95% confidence level. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Our objective was to improve pyrolysis procedures of pig bones for the production of P fertilizers. Bone chars were produced by pyrolysis at 400, 550, or 800 °C with no gas addition; 550 and 800 °C under N2; 800 °C under steam flux, using calcination at 800 °C as control treatment. Synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy at the P and Ca K- and L-edges showed that these bone chars were largely composed of hydroxyapatite. Hydroxyapatite crystallization was inhibited by pyrolysis conducted in the absence of oxygen at 400, 550, or 800 °C, either under no gas or under N2 flux. The clogging of pores by lack of organic compounds removal was hypothesized to cause low surface area of 400 °C bone char, resulting in a fertilizer with citric-acid soluble P as low as calcination, while 550 and 800 °C bone chars obtained in absence of oxygen showed greater porosity, surface area, and citric acid-soluble P than steamed or calcined samples at 800 °C. Although extractable phosphate in water and neutral-ammonium-citrate showed trends comparable to those from citric acid, it was negligible for all heated materials. Since it is possible to produce bone chars with different chemical, physical and crystallographic properties by managing pyrolysis conditions, bone chars can be designed to increase their suitability as P fertilizers for different purposes, such as high solubility or slow P release. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

While better understanding of these forests is critical for our collective future, until quite recently efforts to measure and monitor them have been largely disconnected. Networking is essential to discover the answers to questions that transcend borders and the horizons of funding agencies. Here we show how a global community is responding to the challenges of tropical ecosystem research with diverse teams measuring forests tree-by-tree in thousands of long-term plots. We review the major scientific discoveries of this work and show how this process is changing tropical forest science. Our core approach involves linking long-term grassroots initiatives with standardized protocols and data management to generate robust scaled-up results. By connecting tropical researchers and elevating their status, our Social Research Network model recognises the key role of the data originator in scientific discovery. Conceived in 1999 with RAINFOR (South America), our permanent plot networks have been adapted to Africa (AfriTRON) and Southeast Asia (T-FORCES) and widely emulated worldwide. Now these multiple initiatives are integrated via ForestPlots.net cyber-infrastructure, linking colleagues from 54 countries across 24 plot networks. Collectively these are transforming understanding of tropical forests and their biospheric role. Together we have discovered how, where and why forest carbon and biodiversity are responding to climate change, and how they feedback on it. This long-term pan-tropical collaboration has revealed a large long-term carbon sink and its trends, as well as making clear which drivers are most important, which forest processes are affected, where they are changing, what the lags are, and the likely future responses of tropical forests as the climate continues to change. By leveraging a remarkably old technology, plot networks are sparking a very modern revolution in tropical forest science. In the future, humanity can benefit greatly by nurturing the grassroots communities now collectively capable of generating unique, long-term understanding of Earth's most precious forests. Resumen: Los bosques tropicales son los ecosistemas más diversos y productivos del mundo y entender su funcionamiento es crítico para nuestro futuro colectivo. Sin embargo, hasta hace muy poco, los esfuerzos para medirlos y monitorearlos han estado muy desconectados. El trabajo en redes es esencial para descubrir las respuestas a preguntas que trascienden las fronteras y los plazos de las agencias de financiamiento. Aquí mostramos cómo una comunidad global está respondiendo a los desafíos de la investigación en ecosistemas tropicales a través de diversos equipos realizando mediciones árbol por árbol en miles de parcelas permanentes de largo plazo. Revisamos los descubrimientos más importantes de este trabajo y discutimos cómo este proceso está cambiando la ciencia relacionada a los bosques tropicales. El enfoque central de nuestro esfuerzo implica la conexión de iniciativas locales de largo plazo con protocolos estandarizados y manejo de datos para producir resultados que se puedan trasladar a múltiples escalas. Conectando investigadores tropicales, elevando su posición y estatus, nuestro modelo de Red Social de Investigación reconoce el rol fundamental que tienen, para el descubrimiento científico, quienes generan o producen los datos. Concebida en 1999 con RAINFOR (Suramérica), nuestras redes de parcelas permanentes han sido adaptadas en África (AfriTRON) y el sureste asiático (T-FORCES) y ampliamente replicadas en el mundo. Actualmente todas estas iniciativas están integradas a través de la ciber-infraestructura de ForestPlots.net, conectando colegas de 54 países en 24 redes diferentes de parcelas. Colectivamente, estas redes están transformando nuestro conocimiento sobre los bosques tropicales y el rol de éstos en la biósfera. Juntos hemos descubierto cómo, dónde y porqué el carbono y la biodiversidad de los bosques tropicales está respondiendo al cambio climático y cómo se retroalimentan. Esta colaboración pan-tropical de largo plazo ha expuesto un gran sumidero de carbono y sus tendencias, mostrando claramente cuáles son los factores más importantes, qué procesos se ven afectados, dónde ocurren los cambios, los tiempos de reacción y las probables respuestas futuras mientras el clima continúa cambiando. Apalancando lo que realmente es una tecnología antigua, las redes de parcelas están generando una verdadera y moderna revolución en la ciencia tropical. En el futuro, la humanidad puede beneficiarse enormemente si se nutren y cultivan comunidades de investigadores de base, actualmente con la capacidad de generar información única y de largo plazo para entender los que probablemente son los bosques más preciados de la tierra. Resumo: Florestas tropicais são os ecossistemas mais diversos e produtivos da Terra. Embora uma boa compreensão destas florestas seja crucial para o nosso futuro coletivo, até muito recentemente os esforços de medições e monitoramento tem sido amplamente desconexos. É essencial formarmos redes para obtermos respostas que transcendam as fronteiras e horizontes das agências financiadoras. Neste estudo nós mostramos como uma comunidade global está respondendo aos desafios da pesquisa de ecossistemas tropicais, com equipes diversas medindo florestas, árvore por árvore, em milhares de parcelas monitoradas a longo prazo. Nós revisamos as maiores descobertas científicas deste esforço global, e mostramos também como este processo vem mudando a ciência de florestas tropicais. Nossa abordagem principal envolve unir iniciativas de base a protocolos padronizados e gerenciamento de dados a fim de gerar resultados robustos em grandes escalas. Ao conectar pesquisadores tropicais e elevar seus status, nosso modelo de Rede de Pesquisa Social reconhece o papel chave do produtor dos dados na descoberta científica. Concebida em 1999 com o RAINFOR (América do Sul), nossa rede de parcelas permanentes foi adaptada para África (AfriTRON) e Sudeste Asiático (T-FORCES), e tem sido extensamente reproduzida em todo o mundo. Agora estas múltiplas iniciativas estão integradas através da infraestrutura cibernética do ForestPlots.net, conectando colegas de 54 países e 24 redes de parcelas. Estas iniciativas estão transformando coletivamente o entendimento das florestas tropicais e seus papéis na biosfera. Juntos nós descobrimos como, onde e por que o carbono e a biodiversidade da floresta estão respondendo às mudanças climáticas, e seus efeitos de retroalimentação. Esta duradoura colaboração pantropical revelou um grande sumidouro de carbono persistente e suas tendências, assim como tem evidenciado quais os fatores que influenciam essas tendências, quais processos florestais são mais afetados, onde eles estão mudando, seus atrasos no tempo de resposta, e as prováveis respostas das florestas tropicais conforme o clima continua a mudar. Dessa forma, aproveitando uma notável tecnologia antiga, redes de parcelas acendem as faíscas de uma moderna revolução na ciência das florestas tropicais. No futuro a humanidade pode se beneficiar incentivando estas comunidades locais que agora são coletivamente capazes de gerar conhecimentos únicos e duradouros sobre as florestas mais preciosas da Terra. Résume: Les forêts tropicales sont les écosystèmes les plus diversifiés et les plus productifs de la planète. Si une meilleure compréhension de ces forêts est essentielle pour notre avenir collectif, jusqu'à tout récemment, les efforts déployés pour les mesurer et les surveiller ont été largement déconnectés. La mise en réseau est essentielle pour découvrir les réponses à des questions qui dépassent les frontières et les horizons des organismes de financement. Nous montrons ici comment une communauté mondiale relève les défis de la recherche sur les écosystèmes tropicaux avec diverses équipes qui mesurent les forêts arbre après arbre dans de milliers de parcelles permanentes. Nous passons en revue les principales découvertes scientifiques de ces travaux et montrons comment ce processus modifie la science des forêts tropicales. Notre approche principale consiste à relier les initiatives de base à long terme à des protocoles standardisés et une gestion de données afin de générer des résultats solides à grande échelle. En reliant les chercheurs tropicaux et en élevant leur statut, notre modèle de réseau de recherche sociale reconnaît le rôle clé de l'auteur des données dans la découverte scientifique. Conçus en 1999 avec RAINFOR (Amérique du Sud), nos réseaux de parcelles permanentes ont été adaptés à l'Afrique (AfriTRON) et à l'Asie du Sud-Est (T-FORCES) et largement imités dans le monde entier. Ces multiples initiatives sont désormais intégrées via l'infrastructure ForestPlots.net, qui relie des collègues de 54 pays à travers 24 réseaux de parcelles. Ensemble, elles transforment la compréhension des forêts tropicales et de leur rôle biosphérique. Ensemble, nous avons découvert comment, où et pourquoi le carbone forestier et la biodiversité réagissent au changement climatique, et comment ils y réagissent. Cette collaboration pan-tropicale à long terme a révélé un important puits de carbone à long terme et ses tendances, tout en mettant en évidence les facteurs les plus importants, les processus forestiers qui sont affectés, les endroits où ils changent, les décalages et les réactions futures probables des forêts tropicales à mesure que le climat continue de changer. En tirant parti d'une technologie remarquablement ancienne, les réseaux de parcelles déclenchent une révolution très moderne dans la science des forêts tropicales. À l'avenir, l'humanité pourra grandement bénéficier du soutien des communautés de base qui sont maintenant collectivement capables de générer une compréhension unique et à long terme des forêts les plus précieuses de la Terre. Abstrak: Hutan tropika adalah di antara ekosistem yang paling produktif dan mempunyai kepelbagaian biodiversiti yang tinggi di seluruh dunia. Walaupun pemahaman mengenai hutan tropika amat penting untuk masa depan kita, usaha-usaha untuk mengkaji dan mengawas hutah-hutan tersebut baru sekarang menjadi lebih diperhubungkan. Perangkaian adalah sangat penting untuk mencari jawapan kepada soalan-soalan yang menjangkaui sempadan dan batasan agensi pendanaan. Di sini kami menunjukkan bagaimana sebuah komuniti global bertindak balas terhadap cabaran penyelidikan ekosistem tropika melalui penglibatan pelbagai kumpulan yang mengukur hutan secara pokok demi pokok dalam beribu-ribu plot jangka panjang. Kami meninjau semula penemuan saintifik utama daripada kerja ini dan menunjukkan bagaimana proses ini sedang mengubah bidang sains hutan tropika. Teras pendekatan kami memberi tumpuan terhadap penghubungan inisiatif akar umbi jangka panjang dengan protokol standar serta pengurusan data untuk mendapatkan hasil skala besar yang kukuh. Dengan menghubungkan penyelidik-penyelidik tropika dan meningkatkan status mereka, model Rangkaian Penyelidikan Sosial kami mengiktiraf kepentingan peranan pengasas data dalam penemuan saintifik. Bermula dengan pengasasan RAINFOR (Amerika Selatan) pada tahun 1999, rangkaian-rangkaian plot kekal kami kemudian disesuaikan untuk Afrika (AfriTRON) dan Asia Tenggara (T-FORCES) dan selanjutnya telah banyak dicontohi di seluruh dunia. Kini, inisiatif-inisiatif tersebut disepadukan melalui infrastruktur siber ForestPlots.net yang menghubungkan rakan sekerja dari 54 negara di 24 buah rangkaian plot. Secara kolektif, rangkaian ini sedang mengubah pemahaman tentang hutan tropika dan peranannya dalam biosfera. Kami telah bekerjasama untuk menemukan bagaimana, di mana dan mengapa karbon serta biodiversiti hutan bertindak balas terhadap perubahan iklim dan juga bagaimana mereka saling bermaklum balas. Kolaborasi pan-tropika jangka panjang ini telah mendedahkan sebuah sinki karbon jangka panjang serta arah alirannya dan juga menjelaskan pemandu-pemandu perubahan yang terpenting, di mana dan bagaimana proses hutan terjejas, masa susul yang ada dan kemungkinan tindakbalas hutan tropika pada perubahan iklim secara berterusan di masa depan. Dengan memanfaatkan pendekatan lama, rangkaian plot sedang menyalakan revolusi yang amat moden dalam sains hutan tropika. Pada masa akan datang, manusia sejagat akan banyak mendapat manfaat jika memupuk komuniti-komuniti akar umbi yang kini berkemampuan secara kolektif menghasilkan pemahaman unik dan jangka panjang mengenai hutan-hutan yang paling berharga di dunia. © 2020	Article	Scopus

The involvement of the cell wall (CW) with these sensitive responses and their spatiotemporal dynamics in the distinct root zones remains poorly understood. The spatio-temporal analysis of primary roots of Arabidopsis thaliana upon low pH (pH 4.6) revealed that the CD repeatedly started in cells of the transition zone (TZ). Then, CD dynamically moved downward to the meristematic zone (MZ) and upward to the early elongation zone (EZ). The dead cells exhibited coordinated in situ DNA fragmentation, highlighted by the deformity in the nuclei of dead cells and positive reaction for Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL). This DNA fragmentation strongly suggests that the low pH-driven CD occurred through a programmed cell death (PCD) pathway. In addition, a decreased CW stiffness in TZ epidermal cells before the onset of CD suggests that low pH first triggers cell wall disturbances (CWDs) in these root cells. Disruption in CW integrity caused by incorrect cellulose deposition in cobra (cob-1) mutant enhanced CD in TZ and early EZ. Supporting this notion, an increase in calcium concentration upon low pH alleviated the CD in roots, probably due to its role in stabilization of the pectin crosslinking in CWs and likely counteracting the low pH-induced CWDs. Moreover, the CD was significantly decreased when roots were exposed to low pH under reduced CW tension, however, a sudden increase in turgor pressure and CW tension (hypoosmotic treatment) combined with low pH accelerated CD in TZ and early EZ. The CD was not observed in the wild type late EZ trichoblasts upon low pH but rather an orchestrated arrest in elongation. An increase in calcium concentration inhibited this elongation arrest upon low pH, suggesting that the onset of this response also required CWDs. Altogether, these results indicate that low pH-induced CWDs triggered sensitive responses within defined root zones.

Phosphorus could be more affected due to the main absorption site is the duodenum. Thus, the study measured the performance, phosphorus metabolism, bone density and blood markers in Santa Ines lambs infected Trichostrongylus colubriformis and fed with different phosphorus (P) levels were tested. Eighteen healthy six-month old, castrated male, Santa Ines lambs (initial body weight 22.4 ± 2.7 kg) were randomly assigned to 4 treatments in a 2 × 2 split-plot arrangement. Treatment factors were sufficient (SP) or deficient (DP) dietary P and uninfected (ui) or infected (i) resulting in 4 treatments: SPui, DPui, SPi, and Dpi). Five animals were assigned to each of the infected treatments and 4 to the uninfected treatments. Infection was established using a single oral dose of 40.000 T. colubriformis in the larval stage (L3). All the animals were fed Tifton 85 hay (Cynodon spp.; 60 %) supplemented with cassava and maize gluten meal (40 %). Animals were weighed and blood was sampled weekly. Body composition was estimated twice by computed tomography. P metabolism was assessed by isotope dilution after a bolus infusion of 32P (7.4 M Bq/0.5 mL). Fecal egg counts (FEC) were assessed every 3 days beginning d 18 post-infection, and adult nematodes were counted and characterized (gender, length, and eggs in reproductive tract) at slaughter. The experiment lasted 96 d, and 45 d after infeciton. Statistical procedures were performed using R studio. Infection was successful as evidenced by increased FEC, and the elevated counts were maintained longer with Dpi than SPi. Performance, feed intake, and blood parameters were not affected by treatments. Infected animals had reduced bone density and bone P concentrations as compared to uninfected ones. Endogenous P loss was reduced for DP. Plasma, saliva, and ruminal liquid P concentrations decreased in infected animals. Phosphorus absorption and retention coefficients did not differ by treatment, but the biological half-life (T1/2) of P was reduced for infected animals due to faster blood 32P removal. We concluded that T. colubriformis infection modified P metabolism, and blood P concentrations are an indicator of animal problems, connecting infection and bone mineralization. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The integrated crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) system stablish complex interactions were synergies or competition depend on the arrangements throughout time and space. Fine root (≤2 mm) growth dynamics of crops, pasture and trees remains unclear when these species are integrated. We aimed to assess root growth dynamics after Eucalyptus urograndis introduction into an integrated crop-livestock (ICL) system. Previous ICL area was used as a reference. We assessed ICLF 1.9, 4.3 and 7.5 m distances from tree rows, starting the study when trees had three years of age. Eucalyptus rows were spaced 15 m apart and integrated to annual crops and pasture. We evaluated the root growth under two different successional periods: (i) corn cultivation interspaced with palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha); and (ii) a pasture, when palisade grass was grazed. We tracked fine root length using the minirhizotron technique, capturing 3200 images scanning up to 70 cm soil depth. Data of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmission, soil bulk density, rainfall and air temperature were used as complementary information to support the discussion. Our results showed that Eucalyptus trees impaired root growth of annual crops cultivated in the interrow position, regardless of distance from the row. From 31 to 80 days after corn germination, root length production in ICLF was reduced by 120–179 cm m−2.d−1 along the tree interrow space. For the pasture period, total produced root length density reduced 6% at 1.9 m but increased 25% at 4.3 and 7.5 m, when compared to ICL. Shade of Eucalyptus trees at ICLF 1.9 m position, with PAR transmission mainly below 60%, sharply impaired root growth. Eucalyptus roots represented 12% from total root length produced in ICLF system, and 38% of these roots had positive ectomycorrhizal status. In conclusion, under Eucalyptus trees higher than 20 m, pasture of palisade grass is more adaptable than corn when considering the root growth dynamics of our studied ICLF arrangement. Based on our findings, corn intercropped with palisade grass should not be introduced in future management of the ICLF system, unless part of the trees is chopped to reduce light competition. However, implemented pasture of palisade grass showed belowground synergies with Eucalyptus, increasing root growth in intermediary interrow positions and emerging new fungal symbiosis, which could be playing important functions in soil, as soil carbon storage and nutrient cycling. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluated the effect of liquid biofertilizer on the quality of the Biquinho pepper. Three treatments were tested: Biquinho pepper with mineral fertilizer (T1), biofertilizer (T2), and control (without fertilizer) (T3), totalizing 12 plots. The agronomic parameters were evaluated, as well as those regarding fruit and plant production, physicochemical characteristics (chlorophyll; humidity; titrable acidity; soluble solids; pH, firmness, ascorbic acid, instrumental color), and sensory analysis. For the production parameters (fruit weight and mass), the treatment using liquid biofertilizer was superior compared to the others. Regarding the dimensional variables of the fruit (length, diameter, mass, and wall thickness), the control presented significantly inferior results, besides lower chlorophyll content. The peppers produced using mineral fertilizer presented higher acidity contents, together with the control, and lower pH. There was no significant difference among the treatments regarding the contents of humidity, soluble solids, firmness, and ascorbic acid. Regarding instrumental color, only the attribute chroma (color saturation) of the fruit from the control treatment presented superior values. In terms of size and crunchy texture, the fruit from the treatment with biofertilizer presented the greatest sums, but not interfering in preference. The liquid biofertilizer was observed as a satisfactory alternative for Biquinho pepper production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

In marine invertebrate holobionts like sponges and their associated microbiomes, little is known about virome composition. Here, we characterized the Haliclona fulva hologenome, an encrusting low-microbial abundance sponge found across the Western Mediterranean Sea (35–40 m of depth) producer of a large metabolic repertoire of bioactive compounds and harboring a distinct and stable associated microbiome. Assembled contigs from shotgun metagenome sequences obtained from H. fulva specimens were comprehensively analyzed regarding taxonomic and functional content revealing its remarkable and abundant viral community dominated by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus. Viral families consistently detected in contigs are Circoviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Poxviridae, Herelleviridae, Mimiviridae, Microviridae, and notably the first reported encounter of Nanoviridae and Genomoviridae in Porifera, expanding their known host range. The relative abundance of inferred bacteriophages/prophages was low, suggesting that the prokaryotic community in this sponge has a limited host range and susceptibility. H. fulva showed a distinct viral composition supporting the general proposition of specific and coevolving viromes in marine holobionts. © Copyright © 2021 García-Bonilla, Chaves-Moreno, Riaño-Pachón, Terán, Acosta and Junca.

Two Histosol pedons, located in different floodplains that refer to different sedimentation environments, were sampled in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Morphological, physical, and chemical characterization were performed, and the total C and N content of the substrate and the C content of humic substances were assessed. Elemental C and N and isotope analyses (δ13C and δ15N) were performed every 10 cm, while 14C dating of the humin fraction was performed at 40–50 and 190–200 cm. The interproxy approach combining pedological analyses, radiocarbon dating, and elemental and isotopic analyses of total C and N of organic matter, showed a mixture of algae and continental\terrestrial organic matter deposited in peatlands, over the last ~ 4000 cal years before present (BP). The studied soils were formed by geogenic and pedogenic processes (terrestrialization, paludization, and aggradation). Considering the relationships between δ13C and δ15N, between C/N and δ13C, and the soil characteristics, these deposits were probably formed by vertical accretion in lake environments. However, near 2300 cal yr BP, the radiocarbon dating and isotopic analyses suggest the occurrence of deposition of alluvial sediments transported by the Suruí River in RJ-01. It is likely that the modern age obtained by 14C dating in RJ-02, near 3600 cal yr BP, is probably due to the intense bioturbation by plant roots and the input of young material during the seasonal flood period. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve this, we investigated the relations among leaf carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations, their isotope natural abundance and C:N ratio. In addition, we tested their correlations with mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP), as climatic factors. We found consistent differences in the C and N concentrations and their isotopic composition among the vegetation types. MAP is the main climatic driver of changes in N, C:N ratio, δ15N, and δ13C, correlating negatively with N and positively with C:N ratio. These relations show that these biomes follow an LES. The Caatinga had the highest δ15N values, suggesting that N residence time in soil is longer due to low leaching and plant uptake. We observed that MAP is not the only factor influencing δ13C values in different biomes; instead canopy effect probably explains the highest values observed in the Cerrado. Our results reinforce earlier findings that life diversity in the tropics reflects biogeochemistry diversity and leaf δ15N opens the possibility for investigating plant trade-offs dictated by the LES. Finally, we expect our findings to contribute to a better understanding of the tropics in global climate models. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	Article	Scopus

Nevertheless, the possible effects of this technique on different toxin-producing cyanobacteria species have not been thoroughly investigated. This laboratory study evaluated the potential effects of the “Floc and Sink” technique on releasing microcystins (MC) from the precipitated biomass. A combined treatment of polyaluminium chloride (PAC) with lanthanum modified bentonite (LMB) and/or local red soil (LRS) was applied to the bloom material (mainly Dolichospermum circinalis and Microcystis aeruginosa) of a tropical reservoir. Intra and extracellular MC and biomass removal were evaluated. PAC alone was not efficient to remove the biomass, while PAC + LMB + LRS was the most efficient and removed 4.3–7.5 times more biomass than other treatments. Intracellular MC concentrations ranged between 12 and 2.180 µg L−1 independent from the biomass. PAC treatment increased extracellular MC concentrations from 3.5 to 6 times. However, when combined with ballast, extracellular MC was up to 4.2 times lower in the top of the test tubes. Nevertheless, PAC + LRS and PAC + LMB + LRS treatments showed extracellular MC concentration eight times higher than controls in the bottom. Our results showed that Floc and Sink appears to be more promising in removing cyanobacteria and extracellular MC from the water column than a sole coagulant (PAC). © 2021 by the authors.

The variety of soil types, land-transition options, and management practices present in the Amazon region require detailed inventories to reduce the uncertainties associated with estimates of soil C change. Therefore, we conducted a study covering ca. 1 million hectares to estimate the soil C stock changes due to LUC in Paragominas and Santarém, Pará state, eastern Brazilian Amazon, for the period of 1990–2010. Soil C stocks for 1990 were modeled based on land cover at the time. In 2010, we carried out a field work taking soil samples to measure soil C stock changes in 356 transects across contrasting land uses (logged and burnt forest, young secondary forest, intermediate secondary forest, old secondary forest, pasture, and cropland). The response ratios for the conversion from undisturbed forest to new land uses were calculated considering the differences in soil C stocks, with the undisturbed forest as reference. Between 1990 and 2010, LUC induced a total loss of 1.51 Tg C year-1 (over an area of 7350 km2). For this period, the uncertainty of estimates was ± 23.2%. The land transitions to pasture and cropland were the main drivers of soil C losses. Thus, deforestation contributes to climate change not only through losses of forest biomass but also subsequently soil C losses. These results can inform national and international climate change initiatives associated with LUC in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

We hypothesized that the inclusion of BCI in the diets may lead to fermentation parameters equivalent to those of conventional feedstuff such as tropical grasses or grains; therefore, we aimed to evaluate ruminal fermentation parameters of BCI in in vitro conditions. Three different substrates were prepared: 100% BCI (BCI diet), 100% tifton (Cynodon spp.) hay (CTL diet), and 50% tifton hay +50% BCI (THB diet). Ruminal fermentation parameters of these diets were evaluated in in vitro gas production assays. In a 24-h incubation, increased values for total gas production, organic matter degradability, and methane production were observed for BCId and THB as compared to CTL (p < 0.05), while neutral THB showed the highest value for neutral detergent fiber degradability (p < 0.05). Fermentation profile was evaluated in a 48-h assay: shorter lag time as well as increased gas production potential and fractional fermentation rate were observed for the BCId and THB as compared to CTL (p < 0.05). Our results suggested that by-product from cassava industry is a suitable feed for ruminant production, providing desirable in vitro ruminal fermentation performance and organic matter degradability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

However, the molecular mechanisms that drive OSCC metastasis are unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound particles that play a role in intercellular communication and impact cancer development and progression. Thus, profiling EVs would be of great significance to decipher their role in OSCC metastasis. For that purpose, we used a reductionist approach to map the proteomic, miRNA, metabolomic, and lipidomic profiles of EVs derived from human primary tumor (SCC-9) cells and matched lymph node metastatic (LN1) cells. Distinct omics profiles were associated with the metastatic phenotype, including 670 proteins, 217 miRNAs, 26 metabolites, and 63 lipids differentially abundant between LN1 cell– and SCC-9 cell–derived EVs. A multi-omics integration identified 11 ‘hub proteins’ significantly decreased at the metastatic site compared with primary tumor–derived EVs. We confirmed the validity of these findings with analysis of data from multiple public databases and found that low abundance of seven ‘hub proteins’ in EVs from metastatic lymph nodes (ALDH7A1, CAD, CANT1, GOT1, MTHFD1, PYGB, and SARS) is correlated with reduced survival and tumor aggressiveness in patients with cancer. In summary, this multi-omics approach identified proteins transported by EVs that are associated with metastasis and which may potentially serve as prognostic markers in OSCC. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

Due to the microbiome complexity, graph-theoretical approaches have been applied to represent model microbial communities interactions and identify important taxa, mainly in contaminated soils. Herein, we performed network and statistical analyses into microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from soil samples with the application of different levels of composted tannery sludge (CTS) to assess the most connected nodes and the nodes that act as bridges to identify key microbes within each community. The network analysis revealed hubs belonging to Proteobacteria in soil with lower CTS rates, while active degraders of recalcitrant and pollutant chemical hubs belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were found in soils under the highest CTS rates. The majority of classified connectors belonged to Actinobacteria, but similarly to hubs taxa, they shifted from metabolic functional profile to taxa with abilities to degrade toxic compounds, revealing a soil perturbation with the CTS application on community organization, which also impacted the community modularity. Members of Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria were identified as both hub and connector suggesting their role as keystone groups. Thus, these results offered us interesting insights about crucial taxa, their response to environmental alterations, and possible implications for the ecosystem. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

We describe late Holocene mangroves that established close to the southernmost limit (28°S) for this type of ecosystem in South America. Our findings are based on a 14C dated core obtained from Babitonga Bay, Santa Catarina State, Brazil (26°12′S, 48°33′W). Analysis of palynology, sedimentary facies, isotopic and elemental data shows that mangrove establishment took place ~500 yrs. B.C.E., following an increase in humidity, and expanded further during the Roman Warm Period and at the end of Dark Age Cold Period. Mangrove and precipitation proxies records appear to be sensitive to rainfall patterns imposed both by the expansion/retraction of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and also the interaction with the South Atlantic Subtropical Anticyclone which affects coastal region due to sea surface temperature variations. © 2021	Article	Scopus

We hypothesize that differences in plants and soil properties found across the Cerrado physiognomies would influence the AM community. Thus, soil samples were collected from different physiognomies of Cerrado as follows: Campo graminoide (CG), Cerrado stricto sensu (CSS), and Cerradão (CD). AM community was assessed by 18S rRNA gene sequencing. Glomus was the most abundant genera found in all physiognomies. AM richness and diversity did not change across Cerrado physiognomies. Redundancy analysis clustered physiognomies in different groups, in which CG was the most discriminated, mainly by soil pH and temperature. This study showed that a better understanding of the AM community in the Cerrado biome can help to outline strategies for soil and plant conservation more efficiently, ensuring the sustainability of this system and nutrient dynamics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated whether infection of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) model system Micro-Tom (MT) by the Solanaceae (S)-biotype of Moniliophthora perniciosa, which causes stem swelling and hypertrophic growth of axillary shoots, results from changes in host cytokinin metabolism. Inoculation of an MT-transgenic line that overexpresses the Arabidopsis CYTOKININ OXIDASE-2 gene (35S::AtCKX2) resulted in a reduction in disease incidence and stem diameter. RNA-sequencing analysis of infected MT and 35S::AtCKX2 revealed the activation of cytokinin-responsive marker genes when symptoms were conspicuous. The expression of an Moniliophthora perniciosa tRNA-ISOPENTENYL-TRANSFERASE suggests the production of isopentenyladenine (iP), detected in mycelia grown in vitro. Inoculated MT stems showed higher levels of dihydrozeatin and trans-zeatin but not iP. The application of benzyladenine induced symptoms similar to infection, whereas applying the cytokinin receptor inhibitors LGR-991 and PI55 decreased symptoms. Moniliophthora perniciosa produces iP that might contribute to cytokinin synthesis by the host, which results in vascular and cortex enlargement, axillary shoot outgrowth, reduction in root biomass and an increase in fruit locule number. This strategy may be associated with the manipulation of sink establishment to favour infection by the fungus. © 2021 The Authors New Phytologist © 2021 New Phytologist Foundation	Article	Scopus

High-moisture corn was used as a control. The dry matter content and pH of the silage were measured, and the bacterial community associated with corn grains pre- and post-ensiling was also assessed through 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. The decrease in pH value was directly linked to an ecological microbial succession of Enterobacteriales and Actinomycetales to Lactobacillales in the silage at 120 days after storage, either in rehydrated or high-moisture corn. These results were similar for both maize production locations and hybrids tested. Finally, the similarity between the ensiling processes including rehydrated corn and the high-moisture corn grain silages proves the reliability of the rehydration approach as an alternative for the maintenance of a successful bacterial community structure and composition capable of producing high-quality silages from dent and flint corn hybrids in tropical conditions.  © 2020 FEMS.

Abstract: Climate change effects on natural and managed ecosystems are difficult to predict due to its multi-factor nature. However, most studies that investigate the impacts of climate change factors on plants, such as warming or drought, were conducted under one single stress and controlled environments. In this study, we evaluated the effects of elevated temperature (+ 2 °C) (T) under different conditions of soil water availability (W) to understand the interactive effects of both factors on leaf, stem, and inflorescence macro and micronutrients concentration and biomass allocation of a tropical forage species, Stylosanthes capitata Vogel under field conditions. Temperature control was performed by a temperature free-air controlled enhancement (T-FACE) system. We observed that warming changed nutrient concentrations and plant growth depending on soil moisture levels, but the responses were specific for each plant organ. In general, we found that warming under well-watered conditions greatly improved nutrient concentration and biomass production, whilst the opposite effect was observed under non-irrigated and non-warmed conditions. However, under warmed and non-irrigated conditions, leaf biomass and leaf nutrient concentration were greatly reduced when compared to non-warmed and irrigated plants. Our findings suggest that warming (2 °C above ambient temperature) and drought, as well as both combined stresses, will change the nutrient requirements and biomass distributions between plant aerial organs of S. capitata in tropical ecosystems, which may impact animal feeding in the future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

In tropical forests, the contribution of asymbiotic nitrogen fixation (ANF) to the nitrogen (N) input has been underestimated, even though few studies have shown that ANF may be as important as symbiotic nitrogen fixation in such environments. The inputs and abiotic modulators of ANF in the Amazon forest are not completely understood. Here, we determined ANF rates and estimated the N inputs from ANF in the phyllosphere, litter and rhizospheric soil of nine tree species in the Amazon forest over time, including an extreme drought period induced by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. Our data showed that ANF rates in the phyllosphere were 2.8- and 17.6-fold higher than in the litter and rhizospheric soil, respectively, and was highly dependent on tree taxon. Sampling time was the major factor modulating ANF in all forest compartments. At the driest period, ANF rates were approximately 1.8-fold and 13.1-fold higher than at periods with higher rainfall, before and after the extreme drought period, respectively. Tree species was a key modulator of ANF in the phyllosphere, as well as N and Vanadium concentrations. Carbon, molybdenum and vanadium concentrations were significant modulators of ANF in the litter. Based on ANF rates at the three sampling times, we estimated that the N input in the Amazon forest through ANF in the phyllosphere, litter and rhizospheric soil, was between 0.459 and 0.714 kg N ha−1 yr−1. Our results highlight the importance of ANF in the phyllosphere for the N input in the Amazon forest, and suggest that changes in the patterns of ANF driven by large scale climatic events may impact total N inputs and likely alter forest productivity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Changes in the mode of action of the herbicide through the nanoformulation are key to understanding the efficiency of post-emergence activity of nanoatrazine. Here, we report the leaf absorption and translocation of nanoatrazine and atrazine employing radiometric techniques and compare their herbicidal effects in greenhouse and field conditions. Compared to the commercial formulation, nanoatrazine showed greater and faster absorption rates in mustard leaves (40% increment in the absorbed herbicide 24 h after application), inducing higher inhibition of photosystem II activity. Assays with fusicoccin-treated leaves indicated that the stomatal uptake of nanoparticles might be involved in the improved activity of nanoatrazine. Nanoencapsulation potentiated the post-emergent herbicidal activity of atrazine and the gain provided by nanoencapsulation was higher in the field compared to greenhouse conditions. Regardless of the dose, nanoatrazine provided two-fold higher weed control in the field compared to commercial atrazine. Thus, the design of this carrier system enables improvements in the performance of the herbicide in the field with less risk of environmental losses of the active ingredients due to faster absorption. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

VFs are promising candidates for biotechnological exploitation and implementation of pest-control tools to meet the world’s demand for food in 2100, while sustainably increasing agricultural production. However, VFs have not been used in commercial transgenic plants, since they are thought to target only a narrow range of insects, due to the parasitoid host specialization. We investigated the potential of chitolectin (TnChit), produced by the teratocytes of Toxoneuron nigriceps (Viereck) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), as a transgenic event to control several non-permissive hosts: Chrysodeixis includens (Walker), Spodoptera albula (Walker), Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) and Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). Third instars of C. includens, S. albula and S. frugiperda had lower survival and probability of molting on TnChit-modified plants than on control plants. The nutritional indices of S. frugiperda were also altered. Larval survival and pupal weight of males of T. absoluta were reduced on transgenic plants. Adult emergence of B. tabaci was also reduced. The expression of the TnChit gene differed in the transformation events obtained and was consistent with the biological effects observed. The effects of TnChit on non-permissive hosts demonstrate the potential of the virulence factors that parasitoids employ in host regulation, as a source of new genes in plant transformation for control of insect pests. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Soil carbon is increased under cover crops, and the soil microbiota is undoubtedly modified. However, the effects of different cover crops on the abundance and structure of the soil bacterial community remain unclear. Therefore, this study used 16S rRNA sequencing to assess the abundance and structure of the bacterial community in a crop rotation system under NT using the following cover crop species: pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and Sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea). For comparison, one additional treatment was kept under bare fallow. Soil samples were collected to a depth of 10 cm to assess the bacterial community. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the bacterial community was correlated with microbial biomass N under millet, ammonium under Sunn hemp, and soil base saturation and P under sorghum and fallow. The most abundant phyla were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Chloroflexi under millet, Chloroflexi and Latescibacteria under Sunn hemp, and Proteobacteria and Patescibacteria under sorghum. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that the complexity of the bacterial community was highest under millet, followed by fallow, Sunn hemp, and sorghum. In summary, this study shows that cover crop species specifically shape microbial community structure and networks, with changes in the abundance of bacterial groups related to soil quality and health. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Although, traditionally, beef production in Brazil has relied on unmanaged pastures (i.e. extensive pasture), a growing demand for beef combined with increased competition for land to grow crops without increasing deforestation has led to the incremental conversion of pastures from unmanaged to intensive systems. To better understand the implications of changing pasture management on nitrogen availability and CO2 and N2O fluxes, a field experiment simulating the extensive-to-intensive pasture conversion was set up in São Paulo State, Brazil. Soil and gas samples were collected during two 6 months periods (October, 2013 to March, 2014 and December, 2014 to May, 2015) in an area of extensive pasture (EP), which served as a control, and also in two treatment areas where pasture intensification was simulated using practices typically adopted in the region. The treatment areas included conventionally tilled pasture without inorganic fertilizer (TP) and tilled pasture with inorganic fertilizer (IP). Environmental conditions and soil characteristics were also determined during the study period. The results clearly illustrated the impacts of commonly adopted pasture management systems in Brazil. Fluxes of CO2 and N2O fluxes increased with the application of fertilizer, with CO2 averaging about 4.1, 4.0 and 5.2 g m-2 day-1, and N2O fluxes averaging 0.2, 0.3 and 0.98 mg m-2 day-1 in EP, TP and IP, respectively. Despite equal rates of fertilizer application, differences in weather conditions and soil management resulted in different emission rates and dynamics for each pasture system type. Depending on the sampling period, emissions factors were 1.55% or 0.59%. The adoption of conservation management practices is vital to prevent “hot” moments of N2O emission arising from pasture intensification in Brazil. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

However, the ecological processes that assemble the plant microbiome are not well understood. This study elucidates the relative dominance of assembly processes across plant compartments (root, stem, and leaves) and developmental stages (emergence, growth, flowering, and maturation). Bacterial community composition and assembly processes were assessed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Null models that couple phylogenetic community composition and species distribution models were used to evaluate ecological assembly processes of bacterial communities. All models highlighted that the balance between the assembly process was modulated by compartments and developmental stages. Dispersal limitation dominated amongst the epiphytic communities and at the maturation stage. Homogeneous selection dominated assembly across plant compartments and development stages. Overall, both sets of models were mostly in agreement in predicting the prevailing assembly processes. Our results show, for the first time, that even though niche-based processes dominate in the plant environment, the relative influence of dispersal limitation in community assembly is important. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

A randomized block design was adopted, with the treatments arranged in a split-plots scheme. The plots consisted of three cropping systems: monoculture—Andropogon gayanus cv. Planaltina; mixture I—A. gayanus cv. Planaltina + Stylosanthes cv. Campo Grande; and mixture II—A. gayanus cv. Planaltina + Calopogonium mucunoides. The subplots consisted of two grazing cycles. The highest (P = 0.04) total forage mass (TFM) was recorded in the mixture I (A. gayanus cv. Planaltina + Stylosanthes. cv. Campo Grande), which was 2.6 ± 0.1 tons DM/ha. The crude protein (CP) was lower in the monoculture which also showed the highest content of neutral detergent fiber (NDF). The grazing time in the monoculture was the longest (8.23 ± 1.14 h). The goats used a longer time for rumination (P < 0.01) in the mixture I. The lowest (P < 0.01) bite rate was found in mixture II in comparison to the other cropping systems. The bite rate was higher (P < 0.01) in grazing cycle II than in all the other cropping systems. In mixture I, the Stylosanthes cv. Campo Grande, and in mixture II, the C. mucunoides presented the lowest (P < 0.01) δ13C value in the forage. The highest forage intake occurred in the mixture systems (P < 0.01) in comparison to the monoculture. The mixture pastures presented better results for forage mass, nutritive value, and intake in comparison to the monoculture. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.	Article	Scopus

However, local characteristics mainly related to mangrove structure, geomorphology and coastal hydrodynamics may change the mangrove response to sea-level rise. The most useful evidence to support projections for the future likely comes from mangrove history reconstruction corresponding to past sea-level changes. This study characterized modern (1985–2018 CE) and past (<6300 cal yr BP) mangrove dynamics according to sea-level changes along two estuarine valleys on the southeastern Brazilian coast to predict the mangrove response to sea-level rise by 2100. Relative Sea-Level (RSL) rise triggered changes from a tidal flat occupied by herbs, palms, tree/shrubs to a lagoon surrounded by mangroves between ~6300 and ~4230 cal yr BP. More recently, the RSL fall converted that lagoon into flats occupied by herbs, trees/shrubs, and palms on higher surfaces, and mangroves on lower flats during the mid-late Holocene. The last thousand years were characterized by a mangrove contraction between 390 and 77 cal yr BP, caused by a RSL fall. By contrast, mangrove expansion began at 77 cal yr BP (1873 CE) and continued after 1950 CE, migrating onto higher tidal flats previously occupied by herbs, palms, and trees/shrubs. Spatial-temporal analysis also indicated a mangrove invasion onto higher flats since 1985 CE. These trends are likely related to RSL rise since the end of the Little Ice Age and they intensified during recent decades, when the lower mangrove boundaries remained stable, and mangroves expanded to higher surfaces. Mangroves, confined between steep surfaces, will expand ~22ha under the influence of a sea-level rise of 98 cm by 2100. However, an upstream mangrove migration by 2100 on low and extensive fluvial plains (~4030 ha) will depend mainly on the interaction between fluvial discharge/sea-level rise. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, milk quality has been hindered by tampering, including the addition of formaldehyde to mask product deterioration and increase its shelf life, although this substance may cause harm to consumers. Taking these aspects into account, a novel, fast, greener, portable, and cost-effective method is proposed for the determination of formaldehyde in milk. This method relies on smartphone-based digital image colorimetry of the product formed upon reaction with the Schiff reagent, followed by conversion of the images into RGB values using free application software. Sample preparation only involved protein precipitation in an acidic medium and analyte determination required only a few micrograms of the reagents. The proposed method achieved a limit of detection as low as 120 μg L−1 formaldehyde with a linear response up to 1250 μg L−1 and good precision (CV = 2%, n = 20). Matrix effects were negligible after protein precipitation with recoveries of formaldehyde spiked milk samples within 92–106%. The accuracy was assessed using a reference procedure (HPLC with UV detection after analyte derivatization and liquid–liquid extraction) and the results agreed at the 95% confidence level. The procedure is applicable to whole, semi-skim, and skim milk processed using pasteurization or ultra-heat treatment (UHT). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

To understand the implications of using Eucalyptus spp. in the city’s parks, this study aimed to compare nutrient cycling and litter decomposition between a mixed composition of litter (i.e., native and exotic species) and the litter of a single species (i.e., Eucalyptus). To accomplish this, newly deciduous leaves were collected from two native and two exotic species that are commonly used in the afforestation of São Paulo as well as from Eucalyptus spp. The mixed composition of litter yielded a higher dry mass loss and return of macro- and micronutrients to the forest floor. The decomposition constant (k) values were 0.00322 and 0.00207 g g−1 day−1 for the mixed composition and Eucalyptus spp., respectively. The time required for decomposition of 50 and 95% of deciduous material was 215 and 931 days, respectively, and for the mixed litterfall 334 and 1449 days, respectively, for Eucalyptus spp. Therefore, the mixed litter exhibited greater dry mass loss and nutrient cycling in an urban forest of São Paulo City, since dry mass losses as well as speed and amount of nutrients returned to the forest floor were relatively higher compared to Eucalyptus spp. Nutrient cycling via Eucalyptus spp. litter was less efficient than mixed composition of litter, demonstrating that reforestation programs carried out in the twentieth century using only one species may have had little success. The results of this work emphasize the fact that in urban reforestation programs the City of São Paulo must consider the environmental and biogeographic characteristics of the species employed and use high levels of biodiversity, since the city lies in a megadiverse biome. © 2021, The Author(s).

However, N accumulation in biomass, N2 amounts biologically fixed, and the effects on soil N status are poorly understood for plantations with slow-growing N2-fixing legume trees in seasonally dry environments. In this study, we assessed these questions in monospecific stands of uninoculated Anadenanthera peregrina (L.) var. peregrina (angico) trees established in the Atlantic Forest biome. Nine experimental plots with a stand density of 1111 tree ha−1 were examined about five to six years after tree planting. N content in the leaves, branches, bark, and wood was estimated using allometric equations and N concentration in the tissues. To assess the N content, the topsoil layer was sampled in each plot and in one pasture area. The annual N2 fixation rate at the stand scale was estimated by the natural abundance of 15N, using leaves of angico and a mix of leaves of herbs and shrubs growing in the understory in each plot. N accumulation in aboveground biomass was estimated at 260 kg ha−1 and N allocated in the leaves and branches was four-fold that in the tree stem. N derived from biological N2 fixation was estimated at 50% on average, with an annual rate of N fixed in the aboveground biomass of 22 kg ha−1 year−1. Soil N storage was similar between A. peregrina stands and the pasture area at six years after planting. Long-term gains of N2 fixation may be greatly improved by the adoption of breeding programs for this slow-growing species and the use of an adequate rhizobium strain. © 2021, Botanical Society of Sao Paulo.

However, there is still conflicting information about the interactions of these two nutrients, thus a better understanding of nutritional homeostasis is needed. The objective of this work was to evaluate responses of photosynthesis parameters, P-Zn nutritional homeostasis and antioxidant metabolism to variation in the P × Zn supply of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Plants were grown in pots and watered with nutrient solution containing combinations of P and Zn supply. An excess of either P or Zn limited plant growth, reduced photosynthesis-related parameters, and antioxidant scavenging enzymes. Phosphorus uptake favoured photochemical dissipation of energy decreasing oxidative stress, notably on Zn-well-nourished plants. On the other hand, excessive P uptake reduces Zn-shoot concentration and decreasing carbonic anhydrase activity. Adequate Zn supply facilitated adaptation responses to P deficiency, upregulating acid phosphatase activity, whereas Zn and P excess were alleviated by increasing P and Zn supply, respectively. Collectively, the results showed that inter ionic effects of P and Zn uptake affected light use and CO2 assimilation rate on photosynthesis, activation of antioxidant metabolism, acid phosphatase and carbonic anhydrase activities, and plant growth-related responses to different extents. © 2021, The Author(s).

However, observations of functional leaf traits are underrepresented in tropical regions in comparison with those in temperate areas. Brazil, a country with continental scale and vast biodiversity is a timely example, where many biomes are impacted by human activities and climate change. However, leaf traits relevant to understand vegetation responses to these impacts remain poorly quantified for many species found in the country. We compiled an extensive data set of four functional leaf traits for native woody species occurring in the Brazilian territory. In addition to trait observations, sampling dates and geo-references were compiled and climatic parameters and soil properties of each sampling site were extracted from several databases. Main types of variables contained: The LT-Brazil data set contains 3,479, 1,216, 775 and 775 clean observations of leaf mass per area, leaf nitrogen (N) concentration per unit mass, leaf phosphorus (P) concentration per unit mass, and leaf N : P ratio, respectively, from native woody species, encompassing information of biome, vegetation, taxonomic data, geographical coordinates, climatic parameters, as well as soil properties. Spatial location and grain: We compiled trait observations from 223 sites under native vegetation distributed in all main biomes (i.e., Amazônia, Caatinga, Cerrado, Mata Atlântica, Pampa and Pantanal) across the Brazilian territory. Time period and grain: The data represent information published and/or sampled during the last 25 years. Major taxa and level of measurement: Our compilation was focused on trait data observed for native woody species, excluding monocots, palm trees, herbs, and hemiparasitic plants. Thus, 108, 478 and 1,321 botanical families, genera and species were included, covering c. 9% of the woody angiosperm flora of Brazil.

The nine horizons constituting a typical Amazonian Spodosol profile were studied by different complementary techniques: X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM–EDX). The XRPD analysis revealed the presence of different minerals along the profile, i.e. quartz from 0 to 214 cm (horizons from A1 to Bhs) and kaolinite from 215 to 290 cm (horizons from Tr to K2). The HR-TEM images and SAED patterns revealed the presence of kaolinite in the horizon A1, which was not detected by XRPD. Application of the Rietveld refinement enabled the quantification of the minerals in each horizon. The SEM–EDX analyses allowed to identifying changes in the horizon surface morphology as a consequence of ongoing deformation. A significant decrease of particle sizes and a marked variations of their surface features with increasing depth were measured by SEM. In conclusion, the results of this work provide new insights into the relationship between chemical properties and mineral changes along the soil profile. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Under these environments, field-grown crops are usually exposed to drought and high temperature conditions. Silicon (Si) application could be a useful and sustainable strategy to enhance agronomic N use efficiency, leading to better cereal development. This study was developed to explore the effect of Si application as a soil amendment source (Ca and Mg silicate) associated with N levels applied in a side-dressing (control, low, medium and high N levels) on maize and wheat development, N uptake, agronomic efficiency and grain yield. The field experiments were carried out during four cropping seasons, using two soil amendment sources (Ca and Mg silicate and dolomitic limestone) and four N levels (0, 50, 100 and 200 kg N ha−1). The following evaluations were performed in maize and wheat crops: the shoots and roots biomass, total N, N-NO3−, N-NH4+ and Si accumulation in the shoots, roots and grain tissue, leaf chlorophyll index, grain yield and agronomic efficiency. The silicon amendment application enhanced leaf chlorophyll index, agronomic efficiency and N-uptake in maize and wheat plants, benefiting shoots and roots development and leading to a higher grain yield (an increase of 5.2 and 7.6%, respectively). It would be possible to reduce N fertilization in maize from 185–180 to 100 kg N ha−1 while maintaining similar grain yield with Si application. Additionally, Si application would reduce N fertilization in wheat from 195–200 to 100 kg N ha−1. Silicon application could be a key technology for improving plant-soil N-management, especially in Si accumulator crops, leading to a more sustainable cereal production under tropical conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the knowledge about how soil factors modulate the bacteria community structure and distribution in tropical regions remain poorly understood, mainly in different cowpea producing ecoregions belonging to Northeastern Brazil. This study addressed the bacterial community along three different ecoregions (Mata, Sertão, and Agreste) through the16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results showed that soil factors, such as Al3+, sand, Na+, cation exchange excel, and total organic C, influenced the bacterial community and could be a predictor of the distinct performance of cowpea production. Also, the bacterial community changed between different ecoregions, and some keystone groups related to plant-growth promotion, such as Bradyrhizobium, Bacillales, Rhizobiales, and Solibacillus, were correlated to cowpea yield, so revealing that the soil microbiome has a primordial role in plant productivity. Here, we provide evidence that bacterial groups related to nutrient cycling can help us to increase cowpea efficiency and we suggest that a better microbiome knowledge can contribute to improving the agricultural performance. © 2021, The Author(s).

Spontaneous or induced mutant strains may increase their biotechnological properties. Seventeen Colletotrichum endophytic fungi were investigated for their plant growth-promoting characteristics (in vitro phosphate solubilization, IAA, and siderophore production). The five best strains were inoculated into bean seeds, and the most prominent isolate was selected to obtain auxotrophic mutants by Potassium Bromate Resistance System (PBRS). The plant growth-promoting ability of the mutant was also investigated. Further, 41.17% of the evaluated endophytes presented promising results for in vitro assays (C. karstii SL10, C. karstii SL28, C. karstii SL57, C. karstii SL59, C. karstii SL12, C. karstii SL40, and C. karstii SL24). The endophyte C. karstii SL57 was statistically conspicuous for plant height and root length when compared to those in control plants. Bromate-resistant mutant C. karstii SL57 increased in vitro phosphate solubilization (23%) and chlorophyll levels (Chlb 0.607 mg g-1 and Chlt 0.973 mg g-1) of bean plants when compared to the wild-type strain (Chlb 0.551 mg g-1 and Chlt 0.881 mg g-1). This is the first time an auxotrophic mutant fungus has been obtained by PBRS with a biotechnological application for the agricultural field. © 2021, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

These microorganisms can produce a variety of secondary metabolites, some of which have inhibitory effects on pests and pathogens or even act to promote plant growth. Due to these characteristics, these microorganisms are used as sources of biologically active substances for a wide range of biotechnological applications. Based on that, the aim of this study was to evaluate the production of metabolites of the endophytic Aspergillus flavus CL7 isolated from Chromolaena laevigata, in four different cultivation conditions, and to determine the antimicrobial, cytotoxic, antiviral, and antioxidant potential of these extracts. The multiphasic approach used to identify this strain was based on morphology and ITS gene sequence analysis. The chemical investigation of A. flavus using potato dextrose and minimal medium, using both stationary and agitated methods, resulted in the isolation of kojic acid, α-cyclopiazonic acid, and 20,25-dihydroxyaflavinine. Another 18 compounds in these extracts were identified by UHPLC-HRMS/MS, of which dideacetyl parasiticolide A has been described for the first time from A. flavus. Aflatoxins, important chemomarkers of A. flavus, were not detected in any of the extracts, thus indicating that the CL7 strain is non-aflatoxigenic. The biological potential of all extracts was evaluated, and the best results were observed for the extract obtained using minimal medium against Trichophyton rubrum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. © 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.

This study, based on QuickBird/drone images (2004–2019) and LIDAR data (1998–2013), analyzed the impacts of shoreline dynamics on mangroves (Avicennia germinans) and marshes before and after the initiation of a beach nourishment project in 2013. The coastal barrier and dune crest migrated landward between 1998 and 2013. Meanwhile, the dune crest height increased between 1998 and 2001, then decreased in 2013, probably due to hurricane impacts. The total sediment volume along this sandy coastal barrier presented an overall trend of decline in the 1998–2013 period, resulting in a wetlands loss of ~15.6 ha along 4 km of coastline. This has led to a landward sand migration onto muddy tidal flats occupied by Avicennia germinans (1.08 ha) and Spartina (14.52 ha). However, the beach nourishment project resulted in the advancement of the beach barrier from Nov/2012 to Jan/2015, followed by a relatively stable period between Jan/2015 and Mar/2019. Additionally, both the dune crest height and sediment volume increased between 2013 and 2019. This set of factors favored the establishment and expansion of mangroves (3.2 ha) and saltmarshes (25.4 ha) along the backbarrier environments after 2013, allowing the tidal flats to keep pace with the RSL rise.

When available, however, bone samples constitute very important chronological records for both archaeological sites and natural depositional sites of specific animals. The extraction of collagen was performed using two filters, the first aiming to remove insoluble contaminants, and the second, a vivaspin ultrafilter 30KD to retain large molecular weight materials. The collagen was liofilized and converted to CO2 by combustion in sealed quartz tubes with CuO and Ag. The graphite was produced by zinc reduction in independently sealed Pyrex™ tubes. In order to verify the accuracy of this protocol, we analyzed a modern bone and four previously dated fragments, including those from the Sixth International Radiocarbon Intercomparison (SIRI), and a fragment of human bone from the Amourins site, a Brazilian shellmound. The results for the known age material are in agreement with the expected and the studied sector of Amourins shellmound was dated 4100-3900 years cal BP from a chronological model performed with charcoal dating found in different stratigraphic layers. Samples were dated at the radiocarbon laboratory of Universidade Federal Fluminense (LAC-UFF) in Brazil.  © 2021 Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.	Conference paper	Scopus

Pesticides indiscriminate usage has resulted in an increase in resistant bacterial strains as well as contamination of farmers, consumers and the environment. Plant growth-promoting bacteria and humic acids can act as elicitors of plant defence mechanism causing extensive transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming which, in turn, produce a range of plant chemical defences. The purpose of this study was to study how humic acids and plant growth-promoting bacteria, when applied to the substrate, affected the severity of bacterial spot symptoms in tomato leaves. Materials and methods: One-month-old Micro-Tom tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) were transferred to 3 L pots filled with a sterile mixture of sand and vermiculite (2:1, v:v) and treated or not (control) with 250 mL of 4.5 mmol C. L−1 of humic acids, Herbaspirillum seropedicae (108 CFU. mL−1) and the combination of humic acids plus H. seropedicae. One day after substrate treatment, the leaves were inoculated (or not) with X. euvesicatoria (Xe). The area below the disease progression curve based on severity scores and the number of symptomatic leaflets was used to assess phytopathogen virulence. The concentration of oxalic, citric and succinic acids in leaf extracts were determined using HPLC analysis. Results: Sole or combined H. seropedicae (BAC) and humic acids (HA) application promoted shoot and root growth related to control when plants were challenged with Xe pathogen. For plants inoculated with Xe, more significant plant-growth promotion results were obtained for HA + BAC treatment. The first visible symptoms were observed 16 days after inoculation with 2 × 104 CFU. g−1 of Xe cells in leaves of control plants. HA and BAC applied alone or combined reduced disease severity. Only plants treated with HA were able to reduce disease incidence (number of the leaflets with symptoms). Organic acids, such as oxalic, citric and succinic acids, rose in Xe-inoculated leaves. The reduced amount of organic acids in diseased leaves treated with HA + BAC may be linked to a decrease in disease progression. Conclusion: Humic acids and H. seropedicae increased growth by modulating the content of organic acids in leaf tissue, attenuating the symptoms of the bacterial spot disease.

To alleviate the stress-induced effects on plants growing in these environments, soil fertilization with potassium (K) may affect drought-adaptive plant mechanisms, notably on tropical soils with low K availability. This work aimed to evaluate the K dynamic nutrition in eucalyptus in response to soil-K and -water availabilities, correlating the K-nutritional status with the physiological responses of contrasting eucalyptus clones to drought tolerance. A complete randomized design was used to investigate the effects of three water regimes (well-watered, moderate water deficit, and severe water deficit) and two K soil supplies (sufficient and low K) on growth and physiological responses of two elite eucalyptus clones: “VM01” (Eucalyptus urophylla × camaldulensis) and “AEC 0144” (E. urophylla). Results depicted that the K-well-nourished E. urophylla × camaldulensis clone under severe water deficit maintained shoot biomass accumulation by upregulating the K-content in leaves and stems, gas exchange, water-use efficiency (WUEI), leaf water potential (Ψw), and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, compared to E. urophylla clone. Meanwhile, E. urophylla with a severe water deficit showed a decreased of K content in leaves and stem, as well as a reduction in the accumulation of dry mass. Therefore, the K-use efficiency and the apparent electron transport rate through photosystem II were positively correlated in plants grown in low K, indicating the importance of K in maintaining leaf photochemical processes. In conclusion, management strategy should seek to enhance K-nutrition to optimize water-use efficiencies and photosynthesis. © 2020 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society	Article	Scopus

This work addresses an important aspect of Quaternary research that has implications for current climate debates, for instance, how does vegetation react to changing climate and rising sea levels. Thus, we provide a combined approach using sedimentological, palynological, geochemical analyses (stable isotopes i.e., δ13C, δ15N and C:N), in addition to AMS 14C dating from two surficial sediment cores i.e. T4 (up to 150 cm depth) and T5 (up to 136 cm depth) collected from the Formoso River estuarine system. Climatic oscillations show variation in precipitation and atmosphere humidity, marked by areas of expansion and/or retraction of herbaceous plain and forest vegetation. Variations in vegetation composition over the last 7168–7260 cal yr BP in the Formoso River estuary reflects the strong influence of sea-level variations, which were responsible for changes in coastal paleogeography and paleogeomorphology. Changes in vegetation composition indicate its close relationship with transgressive and regressive marine events and corresponding variation of the depositional environment like lakes to coastal lagoons, tidal channels, sandy strand-plain, and the modern estuary of the Formoso River. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA	Article	Scopus

Even though many works have reported the beneficial effects of PGPB in increasing plant resilience for several stresses, its potential is not yet widely explored. One of the many reasons is the differential symbiosis performance depending on the host genotype. This opens doors to plant breeding programs to explore the genetic variability and develop new cultivars with higher responses to PGPB interaction and, therefore, have higher resilience to stress. Hence, we aimed to study the genetic architecture of the symbiosis between PGPB and tropical maize germplasm, using a public association panel and its impact on plant resilience. Our findings reveal that the synthetic PGPB population can modulate and impact root architecture traits and improve resilience to nitrogen stress, and 37 regions were significant for controlling the symbiosis between PGPB and tropical maize. In addition, we found two overlapping SNPs in the GWAS analysis indicating strong candidates for further investigations. Furthermore, genomic prediction analysis with genomic relationship matrix computed using only significant SNPs obtained from GWAS analysis substantially increased the predictive ability for several traits endorsing the importance of these genomic regions for the response of PGPB. Finally, the public tropical panel reveals a significant genetic variability to the symbiosis with the PGPB and can be a source of alleles to improve plant resilience. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

However, there is limited knowledge about the dynamic of these microbial communities during the composting process. This study assessed the responses of bacterial and archaeal communities during TS composting using the 16S rRNA sequencing. The composting process occurred within 90 days, and samples of compost were collected on day 7 (d7; mesophilic stage), 30 (d30; thermophilic stage), 60 (d60; cooling stage), and 90 (d90; maturation stage). The results showed a succession of microbial phyla during the composting with enrichment of Synergistetes, WS1, and Euryarchaeota at the mesophilic stage, while at the thermophilic stage, there was an enrichment of Hydrogenedentes, WPS-2, Chloroflexi, and Deinococcus-Thermus. At the cooling stage, there was an enrichment of Kiritimatiellaeota, and at the maturation stage, there was an enrichment of Entotheonellaeota, Dadabacteria, Nitrospirae, Dependiatiae, and Fibrobacteres. When analyzing the drivers influencing microbial communities, Cr and pH presented more negative correlations with general phyla. In contrast, S, C, K, temperature, and N presented more positive correlations, while Ni, Cd, and P showed fewer correlations. According to niche occupancy, we observed a decreased proportion of generalists with a consequently increased proportion of specialists following the composting process. This study showed that different stages of the composting present a specific microbial community structure and dynamics, which are related to some specific composting characteristics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

As a result, the increase in diseases and the use of antibiotics to control them during the production cycle has been documented. We study the impact of antibiotics on drinking water, trout tissues and the lake's aquatic ecosystem. Nine antibiotics were monitored: tetracyclines, sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones. The samples were collected randomly and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and the solid-phase extraction system. The sediment samples and surface water samples contain high concentrations of antibiotics. All sediments contain fluoroquinolones (3.74 mg kg−1) and tetracyclines (3.08 mg kg−1) and the surface water contains fluoroquinolones of up to 408.2 and 652.7 ng L−1 in the dry and rainy seasons respectively (P > 0.05). Drinking water samples from the city of Puno collected at sampling points with Lake Titicaca as a source of drinking water, reached an average of 188.1 and 222.2 ng L−1 of ciprofloxacin in dry and rainy seasons respectively. Complementarily, in trout tissues, it reached 7.8 μg kg−1 in oxytetracycline 8.7 μg kg−1 in sulfatizole, 4.2 μg kg−1 in ciprofloxacin and 3.6 μg kg−1 in sarafloxacin. The presence of these antibiotics in surface water is attributed to the aquaculture activity, in addition to runoff and wastewater, and their presence can have detrimental effects on the aquatic ecosystem, and even affect public health due to the consumption of aquaculture products and drinking water contaminated with antibiotic residues. © 2021 International Association for Great Lakes Research	Article	Scopus

Nano-CeO2, micro-CeO2, and Ce(NO3)3 were incorporated into the diet (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mg of Ce L−1). Cerium was detected in caterpillars fed with diets containing nano-CeO2 (1, 10 and 100 mg of Ce L−1), micro-CeO2 and Ce(NO3)3, and in feces of caterpillars from the first generation fed diets with nano-CeO2 at 100 mg of Ce L−1 as well. The results indicate that nano-CeO2 caused negative effects on S. frugiperda. After it was consumed by the caterpillars, the nano-CeO2 reduced up to 4.8% of the pupal weight and 60% of egg viability. Unlike what occurred with micro-CeO2 and Ce(NO3)3, nano-CeO2 negatively affected nutritional parameters of this insect, as consumption rate two times higher, increase of up to 80.8% of relative metabolic rate, reduction of up to 42.3% efficiency of conversion of ingested and 47.2% of digested food, and increase of up to 1.7% of metabolic cost and 8.7% of apparent digestibility. Cerium caused 6.8–16.9% pupal weight reduction in second generation specimens, even without the caterpillars having contact with the cerium via artificial diet. The results show the importance of new ecotoxicological studies with nano-CeO2 for S. frugiperda in semi-field and field conditions to confirm the toxicity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Basilisk and Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Massai from Cd-induced oxidative stress, as well as the effects of simulated summer or winter conditions on these mechanisms. Both grasses were grown in unpolluted and Cd-polluted Oxisol (0.63 and 3.6 mg Cd kg−1 soil, respectively) at summer and winter conditions. Grasses grown in the Cd-polluted Oxisol presented higher Cd concentration in their tissues in the winter conditions, but the shoot biomass production of both grasses was not affected by the experimental conditions. Cadmium was more accumulated in the root apoplast than the root symplast, contributing to increase the diameter and cell layers of the cambial region of both grasses. Roots of B. decumbens were more susceptible to disturbed nutrients uptake and nitrogen metabolism than roots of P. maximum. Both grasses translocated high amounts of Cd to their shoots resulting in oxidative stress. Oxidative stress in the leaves of both grasses was higher in summer than winter, but only in P. maximum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities were increased. However, CO2 assimilation was not affected due to the protection provided by reduced glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatins (PCs) that were more synthesized in shoots than roots.

In this sense, there is a need for the development of antioxidants decelerating the oxidation of biodiesel. In this way, the aim of this work was to evaluate synthetic chalcones, which have the potential to act as oxidative stabilizers, from an initial screening of a series of chalcone analogues at different concentrations as antioxidant agents in biodiesel obtained from frying soybean oil. It should be noted that this is the first work to report the analysis of stabilization of biodiesel from soybean frying oil with synthetic chalcones. Results indicated that all of the quality parameters required for biodiesel were attended, except for the oxidative stability, as determined by standards of the European Union, USA and Brazil. Chalcone analogues were synthesized in moderate to good yields, while DPPH assay showed that these molecules had an antioxidant activity. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that hydroxychalcones had an antioxidant activity in biodiesel at concentration equal to or above 1250 ppm. Therefore, this study indicates that chalcones have a structural template worth exploring to be applied as stabilizer agents in biodiesel.

Abstract: Arthropod resistance in the tomato wild relative Solanum habrochaites LA1777 is linked to specific sesquiterpene biosynthesis. The Sesquiterpene synthase 2 (SsT2) gene cluster on LA1777 chromosome 8 controls plastid-derived sesquiterpene synthesis. The main genes at SsT2 are Z-prenyltransferase (zFPS) and Santalene and Bergamotene Synthase (SBS), which produce α-santalene, β-bergamotene, and α-bergamotene in LA1777 round-shaped type-VI glandular trichomes. Cultivated tomatoes have mushroom-shaped type-VI trichomes with much smaller glands that contain low levels of monoterpenes and cytosolic-derived sesquiterpenes, not presenting the same pest resistance as in LA1777. We successfully transferred zFPS and SBS from LA1777 to cultivated tomato (cv. Micro-Tom, MT) by a backcrossing approach. The trichomes of the MT-Sst2 introgressed line produced high levels of the plastid-derived sesquiterpenes. The type-VI trichome internal storage-cavity size increased in MT-Sst2, probably as an effect of the increased amount of sesquiterpenes, although it was not enough to mimic the round-shaped LA1777 trichomes. The presence of high amounts of plastid-derived sesquiterpenes was also not sufficient to confer resistance to various tomato piercing-sucking pests, indicating that the effect of the sesquiterpenes found in the wild S. habrochaites can be insect specific. Our results provide for a better understanding of the morphology of S. habrochaites type-VI trichomes and paves the way to obtain insect-resistant tomatoes. © 2021, The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

Thus, recycling P from PL to produce organomineral fertilizer (OMF), reduces the dependence on finite mineral P reserves, and also reduces P losses from soil. In this context, a field experiment was carried out to assess the agronomic effectiveness of a granular PL-derived OMF applied to maize and soybean in a highly weathered tropical soil. OMF was compared to single superphosphate (SSP) at five P rates between 0 and 70 kg ha−1 . The shoot dry weight (SDW) and grain yields of soybean and maize were affected by P rates; however, no difference between OMF and SSP was found. A similar trend was observed for soil P and P uptake. The leaf P content and soil pH were not affected by either P sources or P rates. Although there was no difference between OMF and SSP on the crop yields, OMF had the highest relative agronomic effectiveness based on the SDW. These results show that the production of granular OMF from PL is a viable alternative to conventional P fertilizers and reduces the dependence of mineral P reserves. © 2021 by the authors.

When compared with other Hohenbergia species endemic to the Atlantic Forest, the complex is recognized by the small size of the plants (shorter than 1 m tall when flowering), lanceolate leaf blades, inflorescence with main axis short and congested branches, concentrated on the apical portion of the inflorescence (creating a capitulate shape), primary branches short pedunculate (short stipes), basal primary bracts sub-orbicular, large flowers (over 3 cm long) with spatulate petals with a cuspidate apex. Within this complex, we describe H. nidularioides sp. nov., a critically endangered species from the southern coastal region of Bahia, only known from a small fragment of Restinga forest in Una municipality. This species is very similar to H. capitata but differs by the nidular aspect of the inflorescence, which is only short-pedunculate and more or less hidden inside the rosette. In addition to the taxonomic treatment, we provide illustrations, the geographic distribution, taxonomic comments, and anatomical comparison of the species in the H. capitata complex.

Unique geochemical factors may drive the microbial community composition and, consequently, affect CH4 emissions across floodplain areas. Here, we report the in situ composition of CH4 cycling microbial communities in Amazonian floodplain sediments. We considered how abiotic factors may affect the microbial community composition and, more specifically, CH4 cycling groups. We collected sediment samples during wet and dry seasons from three different types of floodplain forests, along with upland forest soil samples, from the Eastern Amazon, Brazil. We used high-resolution sequencing of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes combined with real-time PCR to quantify Archaea and Bacteria, as well as key functional genes indicative of the presence of methanogenic (mcrA) and methanotrophic (pmoA) microorganisms. Methanogens were found to be present in high abundance in floodplain sediments, and they seem to resist the dramatic environmental changes between flooded and nonflooded conditions. Methanotrophs known to use different pathways to oxidise CH4 were detected, including anaerobic archaeal and bacterial taxa, indicating that a wide metabolic diversity may be harboured in this highly variable environment. The floodplain environmental variability, which is affected by the river origin, drives not only the sediment chemistry but also the composition of the microbial communities. These environmental changes seem also to affect the pools of methanotrophs occupying distinct niches. Understanding these shifts in the methanotrophic communities could improve our comprehension of the CH4 emissions in the region. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	Article	Scopus

Brazilian legislation requires that all farms in the country maintain and protect forest areas known as Legal Reserves. Since Legal Reserves have major implications for forest conservation and agricultural production, it is key that we understand landholders' perceptions towards Legal Reserves. We applied Q methodology to identify different perspectives of medium and large landholders on Legal Reserves and their relation to agricultural intensification in the municipality of Paragominas, eastern Amazon. We conducted 31 interviews in which landholders sorted 36 statements in a quasi-normal distribution array. Three groups of landholders were identified: 1) Land use planning enthusiasts (n = 16) were interested in zoning initiatives to explore alternative landscape designs and legislation that may deliver better conservation and production outcomes; 2) Agrochemical-based agriculture supporters (n = 7) held the most critical views against Legal Reserves and perceived their costs as higher than the potential environmental and life quality benefits; 3) Policy complacent-market responders (n = 4) showed no interest in Legal Reserves reforms and were the most market driven group. While Paragominas has achieved notable successes in halting large-scale deforestation through a social “Green Municipality” pact, addressing persisting forest degradation and fragmentation in the region remains a key priority. Local governance initiatives that account for multi-stakeholder perceptions on forest conservation can foster dialogue and mutual understanding to effectively conserve and restore Legal Reserves. Insights on large landholders' perceptions on Legal Reserves can inform such governance processes to reconcile forest conservation and sustainable agricultural intensification in Paragominas. © 2021 The Author(s)	Article	Scopus

Deception Island is a stratovolcano flooded by the sea, resulting in contrasting ecosystems such as permanent glaciers and active fumaroles, which creates steep gradients that have been shown to affect microbial diversity. In this study, we used shotgun metagenomics and metagenome-assembled genomes to explore the metabolic potentials and survival strategies of microbial communities along an extreme temperature gradient in fumarole and glacier sediments on Deception Island. We observed that communities from a 98 °C fumarole were significantly enriched in genes related to hyperthermophilic (e.g. reverse gyrase, GroEL/GroES and thermosome) and oxidative stress responses, as well as genes related to sulfate reduction, ammonification and carbon fixation. Communities from <80 °C fumaroles possessed more genes related osmotic, cold- and heat-shock responses, and diverse metabolic potentials, such as those related to sulfur oxidation and denitrification, while glacier communities showed abundant metabolic potentials mainly related to heterotrophy. Through the reconstruction of genomes, we were able to reveal the metabolic potentials and different survival strategies of underrepresented taxonomic groups, especially those related to Nanoarchaeota, Pyrodictiaceae and thermophilic ammonia-oxidizing archaeal lineages. © 2021 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Glyphosate-resistant kochia exhibits indeterminate growth and remains green during senescence, making it difficult to harvest crops that are contaminated with this weed. Removing dense patches of kochia from contaminated crops can aid in downstream harvest operations while also generating a potential source of livestock feed. This study evaluated the effects of two kochia populations [glyphosate-resistant (GR) and glyphosate-susceptible (GS) kochia] with or without pre-harvest treatment using glyphosate + saflufenacil [untreated (UN) vs treated 10 d pre-harvest (PRE)] on nutrient composition and in vitro degradability when it was harvested at advancing maturities. Kochia (GR-UN, GR-PRE, GS-UN, and GS-PRE) was harvested on 6 dates (HD) corresponding to pre-bloom (HD 1), mid-bloom (HD 2), full-bloom with 50% open flowers (HD 3), developing seeds (HD 4), mid-mature seeds (HD 5) and fully mature seeds (HD 6). In most cases, harvest date affected the chemical composition and in vitro degradability to a greater extent than the kochia population or herbicide treatment. The dry matter (DM) yield increased (P < 0.001) from HD 1–5 and decreased thereafter. The crude protein (CP) content decreased (P < 0.001) while the acid (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content increased (P < 0.001) with advancing HD. Overall, the CP content was higher (P = 0.014), and ADF content lower (P < 0.001) for GS than GR. Total in vitro gas (mL) (P < 0.001) and methane (CH4) production (mL L−1 of gas production) (P < 0.001) after 6 h incubation was greater for GR-UN than GR-PRE across HD. A decrease in acetate (P < 0.001) and an increase (P < 0.001) in propionate concentration with advancing HD led to reduced (P < 0.001) CH4 production after 48 h of in vitro incubation. Dry matter degradability (DMD; %) of GR-UN was greater (P = 0.003) than GR-PRE, while DMD and NDF degradability decreased (P < 0.001) with advancing HD. Pre-harvest application of glyphosate tended to increase the cell wall and decrease non-fibrous carbohydrate fractions, resulting in a slight decline in degradability and an increase (P < 0.05) in in vitro CH4 production. Further in vivo digestibility and growth performance studies using kochia harvested at the optimal maturity are required to define the value of this weed as forage in ruminant production systems. © 2021	Article	Scopus

Auxins play a major role in the plant growth promotion. However, the mechanism of auxin production by the Bacilli group, and more specifically by Bt strains, is unclear. In previous work, the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) B. thuringiensis strain RZ2MS9 increased the corn roots. This drew our attention to the strain’s auxin production trait, earlier detected in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that in its genome, RZ2MS9 harbours the complete set of genes required in two pathways that are used for Indole acetic acid (IAA) production. We also detected that the strain produces almost five times more IAA during the stationary phase. The bacterial application increased the shoot dry weight of the Micro-Tom (MT) tomato by 24%. The application also modified MT root architecture, with an increase of 26% in the average lateral root length and inhibition of the axial root. At the cellular level, RZ2MS9-treated MT plants presented elongated root cortical cells with intensified mitotic activity. Altogether, these are the best characterized auxin-associated phenotypes. Besides that, no growth alteration was detected in the auxin-insensitive diageotropic (dgt) plants either with or without the RZ2MS9 inoculation. Our results suggest that auxins play an important role in the ability of B. thuringiensis RZ2MS9 to promote MT growth and provide a better understanding of the auxin production mechanism by a Bt strain. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

This study aims to investigate whether increasing Si concentrations (0, 1, 2, and 3 mmol L−1) supplied in the nutrient solution is uptaken by quinoa, modifies the C:N:P stoichiometry while increasing nutritional efficiency and crop productivity as well. Our results revealed that the Si supply by promoting a decline in the C levels, associated with greater uptake of N and P, especially decreased the C:N and C:P ratios, favoring the C metabolism efficiency, and modulated the N and P use efficiency for biomass accumulation. This improved nutritional performance and greater use efficiency of C directly favored quinoa productivity. The future perspective is to encourage new field studies with this species to adjust silicon fertilization management to different soils aiming at enhancing quinoa productivity on a sustainable basis. © 2021, The Author(s).

Moench) grain with low tannin content may be suitable as an alternative to maize (Zea mays L.) grain in ruminant diets in terms of input costs and drought tolerance, and effects on growth performance and mitigation of methane (CH4) emissions. Aims: The study aimed to evaluate the effects of substitution of maize with sorghum grain at different rates on ruminal microbial protein synthesis, CH4 formation and liveweight gain in growing ruminants. Methods: Twenty-five Santa Inês lambs (bodyweight 19.0 ± 1.5 kg) were randomly divided into five dietary treatments. Control diet components (on a dry matter basis) were Tifton-85 hay (400 g/kg), maize (405 g/kg), soybean meal (165 g/kg) and commercial mineral supplement (30 g/kg). Sorghum diets comprised the basal diet with the maize grain proportionately substituted with sorghum grain at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% (diets S25-S100). Lamb feed intake, growth performance, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen balance, microbial protein synthesis and CH4 emission were measured during an experimental period of 70 days. Key results: Negligible variations of chemical composition were observed among the experimental diets, although numerical increases in condensed tannins were observed with increasing levels of sorghum replacement. There was no significant effect of level of sorghum inclusion on feed intake. Partial substitution of maize with sorghum grain increased lamb average daily gain linearly (P = 0.02) and quadratically (P = 0.002) compared with diets based on either grain alone, with the S50 lambs having the highest values. A linear decrease in dry matter digestibility (P = 0.02), organic matter (P = 0.02) and acid detergent fibre (P = 0.002) was observed for lambs receiving sorghum diets compared with the control. A significant linear (P = 0.023) effect was observed for retained nitrogen (g/day), with lambs fed S25 and S50 having higher values than those in other treatments. All partially substituted diets (S25, S50 and S75) reduced CH4 per unit bodyweight gain in a linear trend (P = 0.03), by 35%, 29% and 33%, respectively, and tended to increase (linear effect, P = 0.09) the calculated amounts of absorbed microbial protein compared with the control diet. Conclusions: Low tannin sorghum grains can replace maize grains by up to 75% to maximise ruminal microbial biomass production for optimal lamb growth performance and reduced CH4 emission. Implications: Animal productivity can be enhanced while mitigating the environmental impact of livestock production through the partial substitution of maize by low tannin sorghum grains in ruminant diets. © 2021 CSIRO.

The gas production technique was used and the strains evaluated belong to the species: Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Issatchenkia orientalis, Candida tropicalis, Pichia guilliermondii, and Saccharomyces cereviasiae. The equivalent of 7.0 mg DM of yeasts was added and the presence of living cells in them was in the order of 107cells. mL-1. The parameters under study were: accumulated gas production, methane, ammoniacal nitrogen concentration and protozoan count. Only the l. orientalis and S. cereviasiae strains stimulated gas production and the inclusion of yeasts did not show an effect on the rest of the parameters under study. It is concluded that the species and strain of yeast have a decisive effect on the ruminai fermentation of fibrous substrates, which reaffirms the importance of selecting the appropriate strains for being used as an additive in ruminant diets, according to the food you want to use. © 2023 Multidisciplinary Science Journal.

The region's ruminant livestock sector however, is under scrutiny on environmental grounds due to its large contribution to enteric methane (CH4) emissions and influence on global climate change. Thus, the identification of effective CH4 mitigation strategies which do not compromise animal performance is urgently needed, especially in context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) defined in the Paris Agreement of the United Nations. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to: 1) collate a database of individual sheep, beef and dairy cattle records from enteric CH4 emission studies conducted in the LAC region, and 2) perform a meta-analysis to identify feasible enteric CH4 mitigation strategies, which do not compromise animal performance. After outlier's removal, 2745 animal records (65% of the original data) from 103 studies were retained (from 2011 to 2021) in the LAC database. Potential mitigation strategies were classified into three main categories (i.e., animal breeding, dietary, and rumen manipulation) and up to three subcategories, totaling 34 evaluated strategies. A random effects model weighted by inverse variance was used (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V3.3.070). Six strategies decreased at least one enteric CH4 metric and simultaneously increased milk yield (MY; dairy cattle) or average daily gain (ADG; beef cattle and sheep). The breed composition F1 Holstein × Gyr decreased CH4 emission per MY (CH4IMilk) while increasing MY by 99%. Adequate strategies of grazing management under continuous and rotational stocking decreased CH4 emission per ADG (CH4IGain) by 22 and 35%, while increasing ADG by 22 and 71%, respectively. Increased dietary protein concentration, and increased concentrate level through cottonseed meal inclusion, decreased CH4IMilk and CH4IGain by 10 and 20% and increased MY and ADG by 12 and 31%, respectively. Lastly, increased feeding level decreased CH4IGain by 37%, while increasing ADG by 171%. The identified effective mitigation strategies can be adopted by livestock producers according to their specific needs and aid LAC countries in achieving SDG as defined in the Paris Agreement. © 2021 The Authors	Article	Scopus

By exploiting computer-controlled devices (e.g. pumps, valves, injectors, commuters, and samplers), this scenario has been expanded, as a proper manifold dimensioning can be set for each sample. Initially, this dimensioning relied on previous information about each sample, added to the operating software prior to analysis of a given sample lot. Further, real-time decisions relying on feedback mechanisms started to be exploited for improving the analytical figures of merit, simplifying the laboratory management, and allowing real-time system optimization and fault detection. This is the essence of the expert flow analyzers, which involve manifold re-dimensioning by means of flow/manifold programming, often relying on multicommutation. The development of flow analysis from repetitive to real-time defined assays, the involved terminology, and trends on further development are highlighted in this review. Applications involve segmented and unsegmented flow analysis of agronomical, clinical, environmental, industrial, pharmaceutical, and geological samples. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Review	Scopus

Our results revealed higher CH4 emissions from water-atmosphere interface in clear water floodplain, followed by black and white water floodplain, respectively. Active methanogenic and methanotrophic taxa were ubiquitous at 0–15 and 15–30 cm soil layer in FOR and TFS, with differences among the water types with respect to the richness, evenness and diversity of the methanogenic communities. These ecological results were not generalizable regarding to FOR and TFS sites, soil layers, and non-flooded and flooded periods. Despite the predominant oxidation of CH4 in the non-flooded period, higher richness and diversity of methanotrophs were revealed for FOR and TFS in the flooded period. In turn, the structure of the methanogenic and methanotrophic communities and their variation were influenced mainly by soil physicochemical factors, water type, soil depth and the presence of nitrifiers, as Nitrososphaera and Nitrospira. Our study reveals a signature across methanotrophic communities in soils from Amazon floodplain with different water types, with a putative disproportionate role of NC10 phylum in CH4 mitigation in natural and agricultural Amazonian floodplains. These findings open the possibilities to explore the role of NC10 phylum in the carbon cycling in Amazon. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

The experimental design included six N sources applied over sugarcane straw at two sites in Central-South Brazil. Treatments included ammonium nitrate, urea, and four urea-based fertilizers treated with different rates of the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) at two rates of N (50 and 100 kg ha−1), plus an additional control. Nitrogen status in the plant, the activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) and nitrate reductase (NR) in the leaves, and sugarcane stalk yield and quality were evaluated. At site 1, N rates increased the SPAD index, stalk yield, N uptake, and sugar yield. At site 2, N rates increased GS activity, N content, the SPAD index, and N uptake, but stalk and sugar yield were not increased due to large variability in these parameters. All N sources resulted in similar yields at both sites. These results were compared with those in the literature. Among 27 studies surveyed, the average sugarcane yield was 97.8 or 97.4 Mg ha−1 under ammonium nitrate or urea fertilization, respectively, and these averages did not differ by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The results of this study demonstrate that enhanced-efficiency fertilizers have the potential to reduce NH3 emissions from urea-based fertilizers in green sugarcane fields without affecting sugarcane yield. © 2021, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.

In this study, we evaluated the influence of maize stover coverage (S), urea-topdressing fertilization (F), and the microbial inoculant Azospirillum brasilense (I) on soil GHG emissions and rhizosphere microbial communities during maize development. We conducted a greenhouse experiment and measured methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from soil cultivated with maize plants under factorial combinations of the inputs and a control treatment (F, I, S, FI, FS, IS, FIS, and control). Plant biomass was evaluated, and rhizosphere soil samples were collected at V5 and V15 stages and DNA was extracted. The abundance of functional genes (mcrA, pmoA, nifH, and nosZ) was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and the structure of the microbial community was assessed through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Our results corroborate with previous studies which used fewer input combinations and revealed different responses for the following three inputs: F increased N2O emissions around 1 week after application; I tended to reduce CH4 and CO2 emissions, acting as a plant growth stimulator through phytohormones; S showed an increment for CO2 emissions by increasing carbon-use efficiency. IS and FIS treatments presented significant gains in biomass that could be related to Actinobacteria (19.0%) and Bacilli (10.0%) in IS, and Bacilli (9.7%) in FIS, which are the microbial taxa commonly associated with lignocellulose degradation. Comparing all factors, the IS (inoculant + maize stover) treatment was considered the best option for plant biomass production and GHG mitigation since FIS provides small gains toward the management effort of F application. © Copyright © 2021 Yoshiura, Venturini, Braga, França, Lyra, Tsai and Rodrigues.

This study aimed to evaluate a natural alcoholic fermentation for mead process. Bee honey was used, also Tahiti lemon, Gala apple and black raisin in order to diversify beekeeping products and to evaluate the effect. The production of pure mead (A) was from 17.60° Brix, the production of lemon mead (B) was from 16.80° Brix, the production of mead raisin (C) was from 19.60° Brix, while mead with apple (D) was from 16.10° Brix, and all mead were produced from wild yeast present in the environment. The alcoholic fermentation occurred at room temperature for 56 days and obtained alcohol content (v/v) and volatile acidity (mEq/l) in A of 4.92% and 24.47, in B of 1.78%. and 8.71, in C of 6.47% and 11.26 and in D of 1.53% and 6.46, respectively. Moreover, after the 56 days of maturation of the mead were obtained the methanol (mg/l) and alcoholic (v/v) content, in this order, in A of 666.67 and 11.04%, in B of 1,000.00 and 6.71%, in C 200.00 and 13.28% and in D 833.33 and 5.06%. From the results obtained can be concluded that only C is within the legislation of the mead standard, but that A and C yeasts presented the highest fermentation potential. Thus, further studies on mead production and a reassessment of the quality and identity standard agreed by Normative Instruction no 34/2012 are required. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.	Article	Scopus

In addition, biological nitrogen (N) fixation (BNF) in the tropics is one of the key processes affecting the global N cycle. Our objective was to (i) investigate the role of taxonomy and sampling site as predictors of foliar carbon (C) and N concentration and its stable isotopes (i.e., δ13C and δ15N); (ii) assess differences in foliar N, C:N ratio, and δ15N among three functional groups: species of N2-fixers and non-fixers of the Fabaceae family, as well as non-Fabaceae species; and (iii) examine the effect of wood density on tree foliar properties. We hypothesized that Fabaceae specimens in symbiosis with N2-fixers would possess a higher foliar N than non-fixing plants, including those of the Fabaceae family, as well as high-density trees would have higher foliar C and C:N ratio relative to low-density trees, where the latter invest in nutrients instead of structural C. We used a data set composed of 3,668 specimens sampled in three main biomes of Brazil: Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and Cerrado. The partitioning of variance had a higher influence of taxonomy on leaf C, N, and C:N ratio. Conversely, foliar δ13C and δ15N were environmentally constrained. While family was the most important taxonomy level for C, N, and C:N ratio, species played a major role for δ13C and δ15N. Foliar N followed the pattern fixers > non-fixers > non-Fabaceae, while C:N ratio had an opposite trend. In addition, foliar C was correlated with wood density, where high-density > medium-density and low-density woods. The large variability of δ15N was observed among Fabaceae species, demonstrates the complexity of using δ15N as an indicator of BNF. The higher foliar N of Fabaceae non-fixers than non-Fabaceae specimens support the hypothesis that an N-demanding lifestyle is an inherent pattern in this family. Lastly, although observed in some studies, the prediction of foliar properties using wood density is challenging, and future research on this topic is needed. © Copyright © 2021 Martinelli, Abdalla-Filho, Gomes, Lins, Mariano, Soltangheisi, de Camargo, Vieira, Higuchi and Nardoto.

Merrill) under the whole plant life-cycle and relevant environmental concentrations, 0.062 and 0.933 mg kg−1, which represent maximal values for 2017 in agricultural soils and sludge treated soils, respectively. The experiments were carried out using a nutrient solution. Cerium was detected in the soybean roots epidermis and cortex, leaves, and grains, but it neither impaired plant development nor grain yield. The concentration of Ce in the shoot increased as a function of time for plants treated with Ce(NO3)3, while it remained constant for plants treated with CeO2 NPs. It means that CeO2 NPs were absorbed in the same rate as biomass production, which suggests that they are taken up and transported by water mass flow. Single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed clusters of CeO2 NPs in leaves of plants treated with 25 nm CeO2 NPs (ca. 30–45 nm). The reprecipitation of soluble cerium from Ce(NO3)3 within the plant was not confirmed. Finally, bioconcentration factors above one were found for the lowest concentrated treatments. Since soybean is a widespread source of protein for animals, we draw attention to the importance of evaluating the effects of Ce entrance in the food chain and its possible biomagnification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

However, evidence of the impacts associated with RSL fall on the northern Brazilian coast is scarce. Multi-proxy data from the highest tidal flats of the Bragança Peninsula in northern Brazil revealed modern herbaceous areas were occupied by mangroves Rhizophora and Avicennia from ~6250 to ~5850 cal a bp, and only Avicennia between ~5850 and ~5000 cal a bp. The same tidal flats were vegetation-free between ~5000 and ~4300 cal a bp. A combination of a high sea-level stand (0.6 ± 0.1 m) at ~5000 cal a bp and a dry early–middle Holocene in the Amazon probably caused an increase in porewater salinity of tidal flats, which resulted in a mangrove succession from Rhizophora to Avicennia dominance. RSL fall accentuated this process, contributing to mangrove degradation between ~5000 and ~4300 cal a bp. RSL fall, and a wetter period over the past ~4300 cal a bp caused a mangrove migration from highest to lowest flats, followed by expansion of herbaceous vegetation on the highest flats. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Glutathione content, glutathione S-transferase activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation levels, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and frequency of micronuclei and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENA) were measured in the fish. The muscle and gills were the most affected organs; their antioxidant defense was not enough to prevent oxidative damage (LPO) in the IMI 2 and IMI 4 treatment fish. IMI also inhibited AChE activity in the muscle (IMI 3 and IMI 4) and increased ENA frequency (IMI 4). IMI can affect the health of A. altiparanae in environmentally relevant concentrations, causing oxidative damage in different organs, neurotoxic effects in the muscle, and genotoxicity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, the NCBI database includes about 516 distinct search results for Cyanobacterial genomes distributed in a taxonomy based on a polyphasic approach. While their classification and taxonomic relationships are widely used as is, recent proposals to alter their grouping include further exploring the relationship between Cyanobacteria and Melainabacteria. Nowadays, most cyanobacteria still are named under the Botanical Code; however, there is a proposal made by the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) to harmonize cyanobacteria nomenclature with the other bacteria, an initiative to standardize microbial taxonomy based on genome phylogeny, in order to contribute to an overall better phylogenetic resolution of microbiota. Furthermore, the assembly level of the genomes and their geographical origin demonstrates some trends of cyanobacteria genomics on the scientific community, such as low availability of complete genomes and underexplored sampling locations. By describing how available cyanobacterial genomes from free-access databases fit within different taxonomic classifications, this mini-review provides a holistic view of the current knowledge of cyanobacteria and indicates some steps towards improving our efforts to create a more cohesive and inclusive classifying system, which can be greatly improved by using large-scale sequencing and metagenomic techniques. © 2021 Phycological Society of America	Review	Scopus

Therefore, sugar cane seedlings were grown in soil fertilized with increasing doses of P, and the leaf P content was measured by pXRF and by induced coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). This investigation included examination of the X-ray tube operational condition, analysis under vacuum or air, assessment of the number of spots measured per leaf, determination of the acquisition time per spot, and the best quantitative strategy for determining the P content in leaves. Using three points per leaf, an acquisition time of 60 s per point, a voltage of 40 kV, a current of 30 μA, analysis under vacuum, and an external calibration curve considering the densities of standards and leaves, we found a high correlation between the P content in sugar cane leaves by pXRF and ICP OES. A cross-calibration curve can be equally useful. © 2021 American Chemical Society.	Article	Scopus

However, cyanobacteria can produce toxins and have a low heating value. Herein, we studied a cyanobacterial strain harvested during a bloom event and analyzed it to use as animal feed and a source of energy supply. The thermal properties and the contents of total nitrogen, protein, carbohydrate, fatty acids, lipid, and the presence of cyanotoxins were investigated in the Microcystis aeruginosa LTPNA 01 strain and in a bloom material. Microcystins (hepatotoxins) were not detected in this strain nor in the bloom material by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that degradation reactions (devolatilization) initiated at around 180◦C, dropping from approximately 90% to 20% of the samples’ mass. Our work showed that despite presenting a low heating value, both biomass and non-toxic M. aeruginosa LTPNA 01 could be used as energy sources either by burning or producing biofuels. Both can be considered a protein and carbohydrate source similar to some microalgae species as well as biomass fuel. It could also be used as additive for animal feed; however, its safety and potential adverse health effects should be further investigated. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design with five treatments, as follow: (T1) Bradyrhizobium japonicum; (T2) B. japonicum + non-inoculated organic fertilizer; (T3) B. japonicum + inoculated organic fertilizer; (T4) B. japonicum + B. subtilis; and (T5) B. japonicum + NPK. All inoculated treatments were applied directly to the soybean seeds. Soybean was grown in a controlled growth chamber and, on the 40th day, plants were collected and evaluated. B. subtilis increased root dry weight, root:shoot ratio, number of nodules, and specific nodulation, while chemical fertilization increased the shoot biomass and leaf area. The presence of B. subtilis in the substrate was confirmed by the highest number of colonies found in the inoculated treatment. B. subtilis contributed to higher chlorophyll content and it was similar to treatment with chemical fertilization. The roots length, surface, and volume increased with the chemical fertilization and with B. subtilis. Also, B. subtilis modified the partitioning of assimilates in soybean with an increase in root biomass and changes in root architecture due to the increase in the surface of intermediate roots. This study reinforces that co-inoculation of soybean with Bradyrhizobium and B. subtilis is an efficient strategy to improve plant growth due to their beneficial effects in root architecture, which can contribute to higher uptake of water and nutrients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Alternative equations proposed by Groenevelt and Grant (GRT) present advantages regarding mathematical versatility. Considering the VGM model cannot be analytically converted into the GRT model, this study empirically related parameters n and α (VGM) to parameters p and k (GRT). We used 90 value combinations of n and α and minimised the sum of squared differences between VGM and GRT models. Linear equations were fitted and validated using soil samples from the UNSODA database. A singular equation of p as a function of n was fitted, while a two-step procedure was required to correlate k and α. All fits resulted in very high precision (r ≥ 0.999) and accuracy (RMSD ≤ 0.025 m3 m-3) for the water retention function and very high precision (r ≥ 0.994) for the hydraulic conductivity function. The accuracy for the Kr(Θ) function was high (RMSD ≤ 0.50) for 34 of the 40 tested soils. The derived empirical equations can be used to convert the equation parameters for Θ(h) regardless of soil type, and for Kr(Θ) with some restrictions upon parameter combinations. © 2021 2021TheAuthor(s)(ortheiremployer(s)).PublishedbyCSIROPublishing.

The stimulating effect of low-dose gamma rays, known as hormesis, improves the adaptive response of living organisms to more severe challenges. Different areas of agriculture such as plant physiology, crop breeding and seed biology demand accurate methods for real-time diagnosis of the ionizing radiation effect on biological systems. However, traditional measures are still calculated from slow, laborious and destructive techniques, which depend on human vision. Here, we present two robust optical sensors based on multispectral and fluorescence imaging approaches for rapid and non-destructive detection of the hormetic effects of low-dose gamma radiation in soybean seeds and seedings. Multispectral images were acquired from seeds treated with gamma radiation (0, 12, 16 and 20 Gy), and the reflectance, autofluorescence, texture and color features were extracted from images. Next, a chlorophyll fluorescence-based technique was applied to measure the minimal level of fluorescence (F0), maximum fluorescence (FM), average chlorophyll a fluorescence and quantum yield of photosystem II (FV/FM) in seedlings grown from irradiated and non-irradiated seeds. Using a reflectance technology, the seedlings were also evaluated for anthocyanin, chlorophyll a and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Results showed that multispectral and fluorescence-based techniques provide useful information on the hormetic effects of gamma rays in soybean seeds and seedlings, which are invisible to the naked eye. Our findings provide a better understanding of the link between spectral and fluorescence parameters and the hormetic effect of low-dose gamma rays. From a practical point of view, such optical sensors can provide markers for fast, non-destructive and reliable identification of the best gamma-ray doses to stimulate soybean growth parameters. However, we strongly support in-depth studies of the dose–response relationship in seeds with different initial physiological potential from different soybean genotypes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

It is usually adopted to prevent situations of limited supply of nutrients through the soil, to quickly revert symptoms of deficiency already appearing in the field, or to supply plants with nutrients required in higher amounts during specific growth stages. However, the efficacy of foliar application to overcome nutritional deficiencies relies on the effective absorption of nutrients and translocation to other organs of the plant. In this issue, Li et al. (2021) explored the absorption process of foliar-applied zinc (Zn) by non-glandular trichomes of sunflower using cutting-edge techniques to reveal that not only can absorb foliar-applied Zn, but also have roles in translocation of the foliar-absorbed Zn. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

Due to its complexing capacity, organic carbon also plays a key role in the transfer of metals in the soil profile and, therefore, in pedogenesis and for metal mobility. Here we focus on equatorial podzols, which are known to play an important role in carbon cycling. We carried out soil column experiments using soil material and percolating solution sampled in an Amazonian podzol area in order to better constrain the conditions of the transfer of organic carbon at depth. The dissolved organic matter (DOM) produced in the topsoil was not able to percolate through the clayey, kaolinitic material from the deep horizons and was retained in it. When it previously percolated through the Bh material, there was production of fulvic-like, protein-like compounds and small carboxylic acids able to percolate through the clayey material and increase the mobility of Al, Fe and Si. Podzolic processes in the Bh can, therefore, produce a DOM likely to be transferred to the deep water table, playing a role in the carbon balances at the profile scale and, owing to its complexing capacity, playing a role in deep horizon pedogenesis and weathering. The order of magnitude of carbon concentration in the solution percolating at depth was around 1.5-2.5ĝ€¯mgĝ€¯L-1. Our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism that favors the formation of very thick kaolinitic saprolites. © 2021 The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the application of Si via fertigation associated with leaf spray mitigates the effects of water deficit by improving the physiological aspects and modifying C: N: P stoichiometry, inducing an increase in nutrient use efficiency in the ratoon of two sugarcane species (Saccharum officinarum- conventional sugarcane and S. spontaneum- energy cane). Two experiments were carried out in a greenhouse, using conventional sugar cane (variety-RB 966928) and energy cane (variety-VX2). In both experiments, the treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial scheme, without water deficit and with severe water deficit (30% of soil water retention capacity) without and with application of Si via fertigation associated with leaf spray, both in a concentration 2.5 mmol L−1, arranged in randomized blocks. At 80 days after ratoon regrowth, the following parameters were evaluated: Si content and accumulation, efficiency of using C, N and P, C: Si, C: N and C: P ratios, quantum efficiency of PS II, relative content of water, leaf water potential, leaf area, number of leaves and tillers and dry matter production. In the absence of Si, water deficit affected the physiological variables and the growth of the two sugarcane species. The supply of Si via fertigation associated with foliar spraying of soluble Si increased the absorption of this element in the ratoon of conventional sugarcane and energy cane, regardless of water condition. Si attenuated the effects caused by severe water deficit because of the increase in the relative water content and water potential, thus decreasing oxidative stress, impacting photosynthesis efficiency and also modifying the C: N: P stoichiometry, increasing use efficiency for these nutrients and the growth of the two study species. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Moniliophthora perniciosa and Moniliophthora roreri are hemibiotrophic fungi that respectively cause the witches’ broom disease and frosty pod rot in Theobroma cacao. Interestingly, a large number of plant PR-1-like genes are present in the genomes of both species and many are up-regulated during the biotrophic interaction. In this study, we investigated the evolution of PR-1 proteins from 22 genomes of Moniliophthora isolates and 16 other Agaricales species, performing genomic investigation, phylogenetic reconstruction, positive selection search and gene expression analysis. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed conserved PR-1 genes (PR-1a, b, d, j), shared by many Agaricales saprotrophic species, that have diversified in new PR-1 genes putatively related to pathogenicity in Moniliophthora (PR-1f, g, h, i), as well as in recent specialization cases within M. perniciosa biotypes (PR-1c, k, l) and M. roreri (PR-1n). PR-1 families in Moniliophthora with higher evolutionary rates exhibit induced expression in the biotrophic interaction and positive selection clues, supporting the hypothesis that these proteins accumulated adaptive changes in response to host–pathogen arms race. Furthermore, although previous work showed that MpPR-1 can detoxify plant antifungal compounds in yeast, we found that in the presence of eugenol M. perniciosa differentially expresses only MpPR-1e, k, d, of which two are not linked to pathogenicity, suggesting that detoxification might not be the main function of most MpPR-1. Conclusions: Based on analyses of genomic and expression data, we provided evidence that the evolution of PR-1 in Moniliophthora was adaptive and potentially related to the emergence of the parasitic lifestyle in this genus. Additionally, we also discuss how fungal PR-1 proteins could have adapted from basal conserved functions to possible roles in fungal pathogenesis. © 2021, The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

This study aimed to investigate how the addition of β-glucans can affect the fecal bacterial community with possible consequences on animal growth and health. For this, newborn Holstein calves (n = 14) were individually housed in tropical shelters and blocked according to sex, date, and weight at birth and randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: (1) Control: Milk replacer (14% solids, 24% CP, 18.5% fat); (2) β- glucans: Milk replacer supplemented with β-glucans (2 g/d). All calves were bucket fed 6 L/d of milk replacer and received water and starter concentrate ad libitum starting on d 2. To evaluate the bacteriome, fecal samples were collected at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8. The bacterial community was assessed through sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene on the Illumina MiSeq platform and analyzed using the DADA2 pipeline. No differences for Shannon and Chao1 indexes were observed for treatments, but both indexes increased with age (P < 0.001). There were dissimilarities in the structure of the bacterial community during the pre-weaning period (P = 0.01). In a deeper taxonomic level, Collinsella (Actinobacteriota), Prevotella (Bacteroidota), and Lactobacillus (Firmicutes) were the most abundant genera (9.84, 9.54, and 8.82% of the sequences, respectively). β-glucans promoted a higher abundance of Alloprevotella and Holdemanella, which may indicate a beneficial effect of supplementation on dairy calves. The bacterial community was highly correlated with the fecal score at weeks 1 and 2 and with starter concentrate intake at week 8. In conclusion, algae β-glucan supplementation could be beneficial to fecal bacteriome and consequently to the health and performance of dairy calves. © 2021 Virginio Junior et al.

This study investigates the culturable bacteria from a wide range of habitat in a Bruguiera cylindrica mangrove ecosystem in North Sumatra. Screening of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes showed multiple potential traits in amylase, cellulase, chitinase, phosphatase, protease, and urease production by bacterial isolates. Molecular identification based on 16S rDNA region of a potential strain, Vibrio alginolyticus Jme3−20 is then reported as a newly proteolytic agent. The strain also showed a stable growth under salinity (NaCl) stress with considerable phosphate solubilization activities. Protease activity was enhanced by optimizing the 0.5 % (w/v) sucrose and soy peptone in the fermentation medium. SDS-PAGE and zymogram analysis showed the presence of a 35-kDa MW protease. Hence, our study revealed important insights into the bacterial diversity and activity in mangrove ecosystems, evidencing the importance of microbial exploration in this ecosystem. © 2021 The Authors	Article	Scopus

Using resistant genotypes in the bruchid beetles control may reduce insecticide applications, environmental risks, and production costs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate antixenosis and antibiosis of P. vulgaris genotypes to Z. subfasciatus and the relation of bromatological components on resistance. Free- and no-choice tests were carried out in a climate-controlled room (temperature 25 ± 1 °C, relative humidity 70 ± 10%, and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod). Host selection for oviposition, total and viable numbers of eggs, emerged adults, egg to adult period (life cycle), adult longevity, and dry mass consumed of Z. subfasciatus were evaluated on 10 P. vulgaris genotypes. Bean samples of P. vulgaris genotypes were subjected to a bromatological analysis to determine possible resistance mechanisms. In the oviposition antixenosis, none of the P. vulgaris genotypes showed resistance to Z. subfasciatus. Contrastingly, the genotypes Raz 59, 173, 177, 179, 283, 284, 361, and 364 showed resistance in the categories of feeding antixenosis and/or antibiosis to Z. subfasciatus. On average, these genotypes reduced the number of emerged adults in 95.9%, the dry mass consumed in 88.3%, and increased the Z. subfasciatus life cycle in 40.3% compared to susceptible genotypes (IAC Alvorada and 178). Crude protein content in the resistant genotypes was on average 10.9% higher than in the susceptible genotypes. Some proteins, such as arcelin, have antibiotic effects on bruchid beetles, indicating that a higher protein content in resistant genotypes may have been one of the mechanisms responsible for antibiosis of these genotypes to Z. subfasciatus. © 2020, African Association of Insect Scientists.

Herein, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to correlate the non-volatile composition of specialty and traditional coffees with drink quality. The quantified non-volatile compounds included caffeine, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and nicotinic acid in both types of coffee samples, while 5-hydroxymethylfurfural was only quantified in the specialty coffee samples. The most abundant compounds present in specialty coffees were associated with the aroma and flavor, affording a high drink quality. In traditional coffees, the most abundant compounds included nicotinic acid and caffeine, indicating a stronger roasting process, loss of sensory characteristics, and blended formulations. PCA showed a distinction between the traditional and specialty coffees such that a relationship between the contents of the compounds in each type of coffee, quality, and classification could be established. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Additionally, evidence of sexual incompatibility between a long-term mass-reared Brazilian strain and wild populations has been found. To address these issues, this study aimed to refine rearing protocols and to assess the suitability of an A. fraterculus strain for the mass production of sterile flies. A series of bioassays were carried out to evaluate incubation times for eggs in a bubbling bath and to assess the temporal variation of egg production from ovipositing cages at different adult densities. A novel larval diet containing carrageenan was also evaluated. Egg incubation times higher than 48 h in water at 25◦C showed reduced larval and pupal yields. Based on egg production and hatchability, the density of 0.3 flies/cm2 can be recommended for adult cages. The diet with carrageenan was suitable for mass production at egg-seeding densities between 1.0 and 1.5 mL of eggs/kg of diet, providing higher insect yields than a corn-based diet from Embrapa. Even after two years of being reared under the new rearing protocols, no sexual isolation was found between the bisexual strain and wild flies. © 2021 by the authors.

We aimed to boost the classic leaf pigment quantification, adding leaf biochemical information derived from DRIFT spectroscopy + principal component analysis, using the same leaf pigment extract produced by the classical quantification method. We performed a dose-response experiment using P as the limiting nutrient, and maize (Zea mays L.) as a plant-test. After 45 d of growth, we evaluated the effects of P fertilization in total maize shoot biomass, P shoot accumulation, leaf pigment quantification by UV-Vis, and the evaluation of biochemical variations by DRIFT spectroscopy analysis associated with a chemometric approach in the same leaf extract used for pigment quantification. P fertilization raised biomass accumulation (∼7.4×), P uptake (∼2.3×), and total chlorophyll a and b contents (∼2.1×). DRIFT spectroscopy analysis of extracted pigments revealed an elevated content of proteins and polysaccharides at high P availability. At low P availability, we found a low efficiency of N metabolism suggested by the accumulation of inorganic N forms. DRIFT spectroscopy applied together with the classic leaf pigment extraction and quantification method is a novel and promising tool for plant nutrition studies as a DRIFT spectroscopy metabolic profile protocol. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Thermograms were analyzed using specific software with the use of eight different methods. The experiment was aimed at correlating the different methods with each other and with rectal temperature (RT), in order to suggest a method to assess udder side temperature, and also at creating regression equations to enable RT calculation through the use of thermographic data. All methods of analyzing thermograms were highly correlated; correlations between thermograms and RT were significant (P < 0.01) and above 0.840. The highest correlation was between RT and the maximum temperature obtained using a horizontal rectangle placed within the lateral (side) portion of the udder (maximum temperature in a horizontal rectangle (MHR), 0.897). With the exception of the average temperature of a horizontal rectangle, linear regression coefficients were significant (P < 0.05) and coefficients of determination were higher than 75.51%. We suggest the use of MHR to evaluate udder side temperature. The ease of accessing the side of the udder, the welfare advantages of non-invasive observations, and the high correlation with RT suggest the use of thermograms in the lateral portion of the udder to assess animals’ temperature. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

In this context, the objective of this research was to determine the impact of long-term crop rotation and organic and mineral fertilisation on soil humus content, humic and fulvic acids, organic matter humification in organic and sustainable agricultural management systems with low (1.90-2.01%) and moderate (2.10-2.40%) initial humus contents. Long-term field experiments with different agricultural management systems started in 1960 at the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry and soil humus dynamics experiments were conducted from 2006 to 2017. Results of the long-term use of organic and sustainable agricultural management systems with different crop rotations and fertilisation revealed the positive effect of the applied supplies on soil humus, especially for farmyard manure in combination with green manure. The incorporation of farmyard manure and biomass of white mustard resulted in a lower degree of humification when compared to green manure alone, green manure + mineral N, and farmyard and green manure + mineral N. In the low humus content soil, the degree of humification under all agricultural management systems was significantly improved, on average by 0.9% compared to soil with a moderate humus content. © 2021 CSIRO.

Liming is a soil management strategy designed to alleviate soil acidity and mitigating these problems by reducing the TE bioavailability. In this study, we evaluated the effect of liming on photosynthesis, growth, and bioaccumulation of barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), or zinc (Zn) in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grown in a sandy Entisol. The crops were grown in either uncontaminated or contaminated Entisol, at two base saturation (BS%) ratios: 30% for all crops or 50% for rice and 70% for lettuce, sunflower, and tomato. The photosynthesis-related parameters varied depending on the metal and the crop, but in general, increasing BS% did not attenuate photosynthetic damage induced by Ba, Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn in the crops. There was no strong correlation between the photosynthetic parameters and biomass production, which indicates that the suppression of biomass induced by Ba, Cd, Cu, Ni, or Zn is related to other metabolic disorders in addition to the impairment of CO2 assimilation or chlorophyll synthesis in the crops assayed, with the exception of Ni and Zn in lettuce. In conclusion, increasing BS% was not consistent in reducing Ba, Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn accumulation in the edible parts of lettuce, rice, sunflower, and tomato grown in the sandy soil, which is probably related to the low capacity of this soil to control TE bioavailability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

In this context, this study aimed to characterize the spatial variability patterns of FCO2 and soil physical, chemical, and microbiological attributes in a sugarcane field area after reform activities. The study was conducted in an Oxisol with the measurement of FCO2, soil temperature (Ts), and soil moisture (Ms) in a regular 90 × 90-m grid with 100 sampling points. Soil samples were collected at each sampling point at a depth of 0–0.20 m to determine soil physical (density, macroporosity, and microporosity), particle size (sand, silt, and clay), and chemical attributes (soil organic matter, pH, P, K, Ca, Mg, Al, H + Al, cation exchange capacity, and base saturation). Geostatistical analyses were performed to assess the spatial variability and map soil attributes. Two regions (R1 and R2) with contrasting emission values were identified after mapping FCO2. The abundance of bacterial 16S rRNA, pmoA, and nifH genes, determined by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), enzymatic activity (dehydrogenase, urease, cellulase, and amylase), and microbial biomass carbon were determined in R1 and R2. The mean values of FCO2 (2.91 µmol m−2 s−1), Ts (22.6 °C), and Ms (16.9%) over the 28-day period were similar to those observed in studies also conducted under Oxisols in sugarcane areas and conventional soil tillage. The spatial pattern of FCO2 was similar to that of macropores, air-filled pore space, silt content, soil organic matter, and soil carbon decay constant. No significant difference was observed between R1 and R2 for the copy number of bacterial 16S rRNA and nifH genes, but the results of qPCR for the pmoA gene presented differences (p < 0.01) between regions. The region R1, with the highest FCO2 (2.9 to 4.2 µmol m−2 s−1), showed higher enzymatic activity of dehydrogenase (33.02 µg TPF g−1 dry soil 24 h−1), urease (41.15 µg NH4–N g−1 dry soil 3 h−1), amylase (73.84 µg glucose g−1 dry soil 24 h−1), and microbial biomass carbon (41.35 µg C g−1 soil) than R2, which had the lowest emission (1.9 to 2.7 µmol m−2 s−1). In addition, the soil C/N ratio was higher in R2 (15.43) than in R1 (12.18). The spatial pattern of FCO2 in R1 and R2 may not be directly related to the total amount of the microbial community (bacterial 16S rRNA) in the soil but to the specific function that these microorganisms play regarding soil carbon degradation (pmoA). © 2021, The Author(s).

Modern imaging technologies enable the automatic visualization of multi-parameter for characterization of biological samples, reducing subjectivity and optimizing the analysis process. Furthermore, the combination of two or more imaging techniques has contributed to discovering new physicochemical tools and interpreting datasets in real time. Results: We present a new method for automatic characterization of seed quality based on the combination of multispectral and X-ray imaging technologies. We proposed an approach using X-ray images to investigate internal tissues because seed surface profile can be negatively affected, but without reaching important internal regions of seeds. An oilseed plant (Jatropha curcas) was used as a model species, which also serves as a multi-purposed crop of economic importance worldwide. Our studies included the application of a normalized canonical discriminant analyses (nCDA) algorithm as a supervised transformation building method to obtain spatial and spectral patterns on different seedlots. We developed classification models using reflectance data and X-ray classes based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The classification models, individually or combined, showed high accuracy (> 0.96) using reflectance at 940 nm and X-ray data to predict quality traits such as normal seedlings, abnormal seedlings and dead seeds. Conclusions: Multispectral and X-ray imaging have a strong relationship with seed physiological performance. Reflectance at 940 nm and X-ray data can efficiently predict seed quality attributes. These techniques can be alternative methods for rapid, efficient, sustainable and non-destructive characterization of seed quality in the future, overcoming the intrinsic subjectivity of the conventional seed quality analysis. © 2021, The Author(s).

One such group of insects, stink bugs, do not eat large amounts of tissue when feeding on soybean, but are damaging to the quality of the seed yield as they feed on green developing seeds leading to poorly marketable harvests. In addition to causing physical damage during sucking-feeding activities, the insects can also transmit microbial pathogens, leading to even greater yield loss. Conducting surveys of the insect intestinal microbiome can help identify possible pathogens, as well as detail what healthy stink bug digestive systems have in common. Methods: We used the conserved V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the bacterial microbiome of the red-banded stink bug Piezodorus guildinii collected in Brazil and the United States, as well as the neotropical brown stink bug Euschistus heros collected in Brazil. Results: After quality filtering of the data, 192 samples were kept for analyses: 117 samples from P. guildinii covering three sites in Brazil and four sites in the United States, and 75 samples for E. heros covering 10 sites in Brazil. The most interesting observations were that the diversity and abundance of some bacterial families were different in the different ecoregions of Brazil and the United States. Conclusion: Some families, such as Acetobacteraceae, Bacillaceae, Moraxellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Rhodocyclaceae, may be related to the better adaptation in some localities in providing nutrients, break down cellulose, detoxify phytochemicals, and degrade organic compounds, which makes it difficult to control these species.

Some sugarcane cultivars contain low digestibility fibers, which compromises animal performance. Thus, the present study reports on anatomical, chemical, and elemental analysis along stem internodes of two sugarcane cultivars to better understand the structuredigestibility relationship of industrial cultivar cv. IACSP95-5000 compared to a forage cultivar (cv. IAC86-2480). X-ray microdensitometry assays revealed that the peripheral tissues of IACSP95-5000 were denser than IAC86-2480. In the first internode, cv. IACSP95-5000 has more vascular bundles and occupy a larger area. In addition, it had more fibers surrounding the vascular bundles compared to cv. IAC86-2480. However, fibers are prominent at the fifth internode in both cultivars but are more evident in cv. IACSP95-5000. The microprobe X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy analysis showed that silicon and calcium elemental distribution were similar for both cultivars. The structural features of the forage sugarcane presented herein are able to explain the digestibility differences between cultivars. © 2021, North Carolina State University. All rights reserved.

This point of view is, of course, alive under the paradigm that describes a living thing as a whole that could never be interpreted as to the sole understanding of its separated parts. If we are going to achieve the knowledge to understand all the complex relations between the molecules, pathways, organelles, cells, organs, phenotypes, and environments is unknown. However, that is exactly what moves us toward digging the most profound nature of relationships present in the living organisms. During the last 20 years, a big workforce was dedicated to the development of techniques, instruments, and scientific approaches that guided a whole new generation of scientists into the universe of omics approaches. The implementation of technological advances in several omics applications, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, has brought to light the information that nowadays reshape our previous thinking on specific aspects of plant sciences, including growth, development, organ communication, chromatin states, and metabolism, not to mention the underpinning role of regulatory mechanisms that in many cases are essentially the basis for the phenotypical expression of a biological phenomenon and plants adaptation to their environment. In this chapter, some of the original concepts of complex systems theory were briefly discussed, and examples of omics approaches that are contributing to uncovering emergent characteristics of plants are presented and discussed. The combination of several experimental and computational or mathematical approaches indicated that there is room for improvements and novel discoveries. However, the level of complexity of biological systems seems to require and demand us to unify efforts toward the integration of the large omics datasets already available and the ones to come. This unification may represent the necessary breakthrough to the achievement of the understanding of complex phenomena. To do so, the inclusion of systems biology thinking into the training of undergraduate and graduate students of plant sciences and related areas seems to be also a contribution that is necessary to be organized and implemented in a worldwide scale. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

The presence of Cu2+ in water is usually related to human activity due to it being used in pesticides, fertilizer, and algaecides. Previous studies observed that high Cu2+ concentrations stimulated toxin synthesis in cyanobacteria and microalgae. Furthermore, saxitoxins (STXs) can bind to Cu2+ transporters in microorganisms, decreasing the Cu2+ uptake and consequently reducing Cu toxicity. Therefore, considering the invasive capacity of the cyanobacterium Raphidiopsis raciborskii and its potential for STXs production, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of different Cu2+ concentrations in the production of STXs and growth of R. raciborskii. In acclimatized growth conditions, cultures of R. raciborskii strain (ITUC01) were exposed to four different copper concentrations for 20 days (0.8, 8, 80, and 800 × 10−3 μmol L−1 of CuCl2). Raphidiopsis raciborskii growth and physiological responses were evaluated measuring the cell concentration, cell volume, biovolume, chlorophyll a levels, and STXs concentration. Comparing the lowest and highest Cu2+ concentration (0.8 and 800 × 10−3 μmol L−1), it was observed that the increment of Cu2+ in the medium led to a reduced maximum growth rate (μmax), cell concentration, biovolume, and chlorophyll a levels, while the cell volume increased. Despite the low cell concentration and biovolume in the highest Cu2+ condition, it was observed that the STXs volumetric concentration was significantly high on day 5, which is indicative of the fact that increased Cu2+ concentration might induce STXs production in early growth. In addition, our results revealed that STXs production was uncoupled with growth and a reduction of R. raciborskii toxicity from day 5 to 20 was observed. Therefore, the present study identified some of the survival responses of R. raciborskii in Cu-stressed condition and suggested that Cu2+ might be one of the factors that can affect R. raciborskii bloom toxicity. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.

Despite the recognized significance of reservoirs to the global methane (CH4) emission, the processes controlling this emission remain poorly understood, especially in Tropical reservoirs. Here we evaluate CH4 dynamics in the main channel and downstream of the Santo Antônio hydroelectric reservoir, a large tropical run-of-the-river (ROR) reservoir in Amazonia. This study is intended to give a snapshot of the CH4 dynamics during the falling water season at the initial stage after the start of operations. Our results show substantial and higher CH4 production in reservoirs’ littoral sediment than in the naturally flooded areas downstream of the dam. Despite the large production in the reservoir or naturally flooded areas, high CH4 oxidation in the main channel keep the concentration and fluxes of CH4 in the main channel low. Similar CH4 concentrations in the reservoir and downstream close to the dam suggest negligible degassing at the dam, but stable isotopic evidence indicates the presence of a less oxidized pool of CH4 after the dam. ROR reservoirs are designed to disturb the natural river flow dynamics less than traditional reservoirs. If enough mixing and oxygenation remain throughout the reservoir’s water column, naturally high CH4 oxidation rates can also remain and limit the diffusive CH4 emissions from the main channel. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that our results focused on emissions in the deep and oxygenated main channel. High emissions, mainly through ebullition, may occur in the vast and shallow areas represented by bays and tributaries. However, detailed assessments are still required to understand the impacts of this reservoir on the annual emissions of CH4. © Copyright © 2021 Sawakuchi, Bastviken, Enrich-Prast, Ward, Camargo and Richey.

More than two thousand cyanobacterial secondary metabolites have been reported from diverse sources over the past fifty years. A comprehensive, publically-accessible database detailing these secondary metabolites would facilitate research into their occurrence, functions and toxicological risks. To address this need we created CyanoMetDB, a highly curated, flat-file, openly-accessible database of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites collated from 850 peer-reviewed articles published between 1967 and 2020. CyanoMetDB contains 2010 cyanobacterial metabolites and 99 structurally related compounds. This has nearly doubled the number of entries with complete literature metadata and structural composition information compared to previously available open access databases. The dataset includes microcytsins, cyanopeptolins, other depsipeptides, anabaenopeptins, microginins, aeruginosins, cyclamides, cryptophycins, saxitoxins, spumigins, microviridins, and anatoxins among other metabolite classes. A comprehensive database dedicated to cyanobacterial secondary metabolites facilitates: (1) the detection and dereplication of known cyanobacterial toxins and secondary metabolites; (2) the identification of novel natural products from cyanobacteria; (3) research on biosynthesis of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites, including substructure searches; and (4) the investigation of their abundance, persistence, and toxicity in natural environments. © 2021	Article	Scopus

Glandular trichomes produce a rich repertoire of secondary metabolites, whereas non-glandular trichomes create a physical barrier on the epidermis: both operate in tandem against biotic and abiotic stressors. A deeper understanding of trichome development and function would enable the breeding of more resilient crops. However, little is known about the impact of altered trichome density on leaf photosynthesis, gas exchange and energy balance. Previous work has compared multiple, closely related species differing in trichome density. Here, we analysed monogenic trichome mutants in the same tomato genetic background (Solanum lycopersicum cv. ‘Micro-Tom’). We determined growth parameters, leaf spectral properties, gas exchange and leaf temperature in the hairs absent (h), Lanata (Ln) and Woolly (Wo) trichome mutants. Shoot dry weight, leaf area, leaf spectral properties and cuticular conductance were not affected by the mutations. However, the Ln mutant showed increased net carbon assimilation rate (An), associated with higher stomatal conductance (gs), with no differences in stomatal density or stomatal index between genotypes. Leaf temperature was furthermore reduced in Ln in the hottest, early hours of the afternoon. We show that a single monogenic mutation that modifies trichome density, a desirable trait for crop breeding, concomitantly improves leaf gas exchange and reduces leaf temperature. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH	Article	Scopus

Bacaba (Oenocarpus bacaba Mart.) has a high yield of oil, with the potential to produce biologically active natural products and can be considered a new “superfruit” with high value added. Materials and methods. Acid value, peroxide value, refractive index, saponification value, p-anisidine value, relative density, iodine value, total oxidation value, specific extinction coefficients at 232 and 270 nm (K232and K270), ΔK, and color were determined. Results. The most significant changes in the quality values, such as peroxide (26.25 mEq·kg-1), p-anisidine (11.41), acidity (14.66 mg KOH·g-1oil), and total oxidation (63.92) were determined for 15 min of microwave heating. Conclusions. The microwave heating promoted the acceleration of oxidative processes showing that, overall, much care should be taken when heating the bacaba oil by microwave to avoid oil degradation. © Copyright by Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Przyrodniczego w Poznaniu	Article	Scopus

To obtain robust phylogeny of this type species, we have generated whole-genome sequencing of the bloom-forming Anabaenopsis elenkinii strain CCIBt3563 isolated from a Brazilian soda lake. This strain presents the typical morphology of A. elenkinii with short and curved trichomes with apical heterocytes established after separation of paired inter-calary heterocytes and also regarding to cell dimensions. Its genome size is 4 495 068 bp, with a G+C content of 41.98 %, a total of 3932 potential protein coding genes and four 16S rRNA genes. Phylogenomic tree inferred by RAxML based on the alignment of 120 conserved proteins using GTDB-Tk grouped A. elenkinii CCIBt3563 together with other genera of the family Apha-nizomenonaceae. However, the only previous available genome of Anabaenopsis circularis NIES-21 was distantly positioned within a clade of Desikacharya strains, a genus from the family Nostocaceae. Furthermore, average nucleotide identity values from 86–98 % were obtained among NIES-21 and Desikacharya genomes, while this value was 76.04 % between NIES-21 and the CCIBt3563 genome. These findings were also corroborated by the phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNA gene sequences, which also showed a strongly supported subcluster of A. elenkinii strains from Brazilian, Mexican and Kenyan soda lakes. This study presents the phylogenomics and genome-scale analyses of an Anabaenopsis elenkinii strain, improving molecular basis for demarcation of this species and framework for the classification of cyanobacteria based on the polyphasic approach. © 2021 The Authors.

Properties associated with nanosized objects might be desirable, but may pose a threat to the environment since the fate of nanomaterials is poorly understood. Seed treatment is an extensive practice to provide micronutrients and disease protection. This study investigates the effect of Ag2S NPs, Ag0NPs, and AgNO3(1, 100, and 1000 mg Ag per L) on the germination ofPhaseolus vulgarisseeds and the mechanism of interaction in the seed coat. Ag treatments did not affect the germination rate. On the other hand, the development of seedlings was significantly improved by Ag2S NPs while AgNO3showed a negative effect compared to the control (water). Silver from different sources was accumulated and biotransformed along the seed coat. Ag from the AgNO3treatment was found as AgCl and bound to oxygen, and Ag0NPs underwent oxidative dissolution forming thiolate complexes. On the other hand, Ag2S NPs did not show any detectable chemical changes. Silver distribution and speciation were investigated in the bean testa using μ-XRF and μ-XANES, while the macromolecular composition was assessed by ATR-FTIR. The Ag biotransformation depended on the source. For the FTIR results, it is possible to verify perturbations in the carbohydrate region as well as changes in the protein region. The combination of these results can contribute to building another step in the understanding of how nanoparticles can improve agricultural inputs and benefit food crops. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

The treatments comprised hydroponic-cultivated Darkibor (A), Darkibor cultivated in field (B), HS2O (C), Arielli (D) and Kobe (E), these last three cultivated under conventional system (field-cultivated). The panelists indicated the significant attributes that described the differences in kale sensory profiles. Darkibor (A) and Arielli (D) kale leaves had the lightest green color. Regarding their format, the kales were classified into smooth and curly. Both the Darkibor grown in field (B) and Arielli (D) had the most intense bitter taste. Darkibor (A) showed the highest intensity for sweet taste, followed by Arielli (D). The field-cultivated Darkibor (B) ranked the highest crispness and mouthfeel (sensation produced by a particular food in the mouth). The color and texture of the kale leaves affected purchase intention by the consumer, and the color showed a difference among the kales, with Darkibor kale (A) receiving the lowest score. Darkibor (A) obtained lower buying-likelihood scores, reinforcing that color affects consumers’ purchase intention. © 2021, Sociedade de Olericultura do Brasil. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

Abstract: Plants being sessile organisms are constantly confronted with several biotic and abiotic stresses. Sugarcane (Saccharum spp) is a major tropical crop widely cultivated for its sugar and other by-products. In Brazil, sugarcane plantations account for significant production losses due to Sphenophorus levis (sugarcane weevil) infestations. With the existing control measures being less effective, there arises a necessity for advanced strategies. Our bioassay injection experiments with V-ATPase E dsRNA in S. levis larvae showed significant mortality and reduction in transcription levels. Furthermore, we down-regulated the V-ATPase E gene of S. levis in transgenic sugarcane using an RNAi approach. The resultant RNAi transgenic lines exhibited reduction in larval growth and survival, without compromising plant performance under controlled environment. Our results illustrate that RNAi-mediated down-regulation of key genes is a promising approach in imparting resistance to sugarcane weevil. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

Methods: This review was conducted based on the Brazilian guidance tools as RDC 53/2015, Guide 4 and Question and Answer resource; references used as international guides; and articles in the field of degradation product analyses. Results: Characterization of the impurity profile for a substance, and development of indicative stability methods are essential criteria for compliance with current legislation, and address a legitimate health concern. As this matter falls under the purview of recently published regulation, many doubts remain regarding methods of conducting studies of forced degradation, and development of methods indicative of stability. Analytical conditions predict degradation after exposing them to thermal, humid, acidic, basic, oxidation, photolytic, and metal ion conditions. Conclusions: Although RDC 53/2015 outlines the parameters of degradation, the analytical conditions are not specified, as well as in other international standards. A well-designed forced degradation study is key to obtaining a good stability indicating method with peak purity and mass balance. © Farias et al.	Article	Scopus

In this study, the steady infiltration rate measured with a double ring infiltrometer (isr-dri) in different layers of a soil profile was compared between layers and with the steady vertical saturated flow rate estimated by the Richards equation (isr-hy). The measurements of isr-dri at the top of the A, E, and Bt horizons were compared to each other and also compared with the isr-hy to detect the occurrence of lateral flow in double ring infiltrometer measurements. The isr-dri in the A horizon (236 mm h-1) was around 10 times higher than in the Bt horizon (20 mm h-1), which implies in a lateral flow of almost 90 % in the surface horizon. The occurrence of lateral flow in double ring infiltrometer measurements was also shown by comparing isr-dri with the vertical saturated flow rate estimated with the Richards equation, isr-hy. The main conclusion is that isr-dri measured at the soil surface overestimates the steady infiltration rate of soil profiles when underlying horizons are less permeable and more restrictive to water flow.

While this cultivation system has often been framed as contributing to environmental degradation, it can also be argued to be compatible with sustainable agricultural practices. Its sustainability strongly depends on the length of the recovery period, the period of secondary forest succession, after swidden agriculture. In this study we focused on soil fertility maintenance and recovery during secondary succession after swidden agriculture, compared to old-growth forests. Smallholders practiced a moderate form of swidden agriculture, abandoned the production field after one or two production cycles, and returned to the field after 10–15 years. Sampling took place in two traditional communities situated in the southeast portion of the Atlantic Rainforest at São Paulo state, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from forest fragments belonging to seven different Caiçara families (descendants from Amerindians, African Brazilian and European colonizers). Our chronosequence spanned a period of sixty years, while the old-growth forests were 100 years old. In all 28 sites were sampled, of which 19 were from ombrophilous forests on clay and 9 from restinga vegetation on sandy soil. Soils were analyzed for texture, macro- and micronutrient availability, bulk density, pH and nitrogen and carbon stocks. Linear regression, with clay content and fallow period as main factors, showed that successional age of the forest stand had only a significant effect on pH and Mn. Clay content of the soil influenced availability of nutrient bases and the CEC. Other soil properties, including stocks of carbon and nitrogen were not influenced by fallow period. Our data indicate that swidden agriculture might not lose key soil nutrients over time and hence can be considered an ecologically sustainable system in the region, challenging the negative perception of swidden agriculture. © 2020 The Author(s)	Article	Scopus

In sheep infected with T. colubriformis there is a high reduction in P bioavailability, because of depression in the absorptive capacity of this mineral, affecting the absorption and recycling of P to the digestive tract, causing mineral deficiency. Therefore, precision feeding compiles animal genetics information, feeding type and grazing management to control animal feed intake and quantity and quality of manure produced. In this sense, the adoption of precision feeding can provide a better arrangement of the information, making sheep production more economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. © 2021, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology.

Hence, measures for the degradation of fungicide residues are needed. In the present study, the efficiency of gamma radiation (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 4.0 kGy) in the decomposition of carbendazim and azoxystrobin levels in strawberries was monitored. Irradiated strawberry samples were extracted using the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, Safe) protocol. Quantification of carbendazim and azoxystrobin was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. The radiation doses of 1.5, 2.0, and 4.0 kGy degraded 13.17, 15.95, and 27.99% of carbendazim and 25.53, 32.32 and 56.70% of azoxystrobin, respectively. Determination of the radiation dose required to decrease the fungicides by 50% (RD50) revealed that carbendazim was more resistant than azoxystrobin to gamma radiation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

This study examines a mangrove sediment core to evaluate the potential environmental impact of a large-scale port-industrial construction in a tropical lagoonal–estuary near Recife, NE Brazil. Here, we measure sediment accretionrate (SAR), carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N), total organic matter (TOM), total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon (TOC), and carbonate content (CaCO 3) to determine the impact of Suape's Port-Industrial Complex in the adjacent estuarine system. We identify a high SAR (1.37 cm yr −1) and propose three main depositional phases in the 82 cm sediment core. The first phase (circa 1956–1973) corresponds to the period prior to the installation of the Suape port complex, where the sediments are characterized by containing sand and organic material derived from terrestrial sources. The second phase (c. 1976–1986) shows signatures that reflect the installation of the Suape port complex and the intensification of the sugarcane monoculture in the catchment area. This phase shows an increase of mud and carbonate content, interpreted as a predominance of marine sediment source due to the morphological changes along the estuary. The third and final phase (c. 1986–2015) contains fluctuating results, reflecting an increase of land use, but not as intense as the period after the installation of the port complex (phase 2). Our results show a biogeochemical and sediment signature shifts directly related to anthropogenic impacts and natural factors. Overall, this study reveals a shift in the sediment sources and composition in the Suape estuarine system as a consequence of human development adjacent to estuarine areas and the resilience of mangrove ecosystems to adapt to anthropogenic impact. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Their microbial inhabitants are often recruited to withstand stressful settings and improve plant growth under harsh conditions. Thus, plant-associated microorganisms isolated from semiarid and seasonally dry environments will be detailed in the present review, focusing on plant growth promotion potential and the microbial ability to alleviate plant abiotic stress. Initially, we explored the role of microbes from dry environments around the world, and then, we focused on seasonally dry Brazilian biomes, the Caatinga and the Cerrado. Cultivable bacteria from semiarid and seasonally dry environments have demonstrated great plant growth promotion traits such as plant hormone production, mobilization of insoluble nutrients, and mechanisms related to plant abiotic stress alleviation. Several of these isolates were able to improve plant growth under stressful conditions commonly present in typical semiarid regions, such as high salinity and drought. Additionally, we highlight the potential of plants highly adapted to seasonal climates from the Caatinga and Cerrado biomes as a suitable pool of microbial inoculants to maintain plant growth under abiotic stress conditions. In general, we point out the potential for the exploitation of new microbial inoculants from plants growing in dry environments to ensure a sustainable increase in agricultural productivity in a future climate change scenario. © Copyright © 2021 Bonatelli, Lacerda-Júnior, dos Reis Junior, Fernandes-Júnior, Melo and Quecine.

Therefore, 5,081 observations were used from previous experiments with animals from different Brazilian regions with the time of day, gender, breed, age, physiological characteristics, hematological and climatic variables. The animals were classified according to their stress level, and only data of non-stressed animals were used to calculate the reference values. Respiratory rate was the parameter that most differed from the normal range, with values above the limits usually reported for the species, being higher in commercial wool sheep. For hematological variables, differences were observed between the present results and the previously reported values in the literature. A higher number of red blood cells (RBC), lower hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were observed in young animals. A higher number of RBC and MCHC were noted in sheep crossed with local breeds. Considering that physiological and hematological parameters are indicators of the animal’s pathological or physiological state, for a correct interpretation of the results, the use of reference values based on animals with similar racial characteristics and subjected to similar environmental conditions is recommended. © 2021	Article	Scopus

Assessments of sugarcane yield loss based on these factors may become more accurate by using the stable carbon (C) isotope technique. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of N and water on sugarcane yield, isolating the yield losses (YL) caused by N or by water limitations, and correlating them with the fractionation of C isotopes (Δ13C). The research was carried out in field conditions in the municipality of Jaú, Brazil. A statistical design in randomized block was used, considering the 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, composed of two cycles [first (2008/09) and second (2009/10)], two N rates (without and with N) and two water supplies (rainfed and irrigated). These variables were evaluated: biometric features (plant height, stalk diameter and tillering), yield elements [stalk yield (STY), sucrose yield (SUY), and stalk dry matter (SDM)], technological quality parameters [fiber content, sucrose juice content (SJC), and total sucrose recovery (TSR)], stalk N concentration (SNC) and accumulation (SNA), and Δ13C. The effect of irrigation associated with N fertilization on STY, SUY, and SDM, resulted in average increases of 53.7, 9.0, and 18.6 Mg ha-1, respectively. The average YL for STY in two crop seasons were 40.5%, 35.2%, and 48.2% due to limitations of N or water or N+water, respectively. The SNC was not affected by the water supply, but it was increased by N fertilization. The highest value of Δ13C was obtained for the treatment without N fertilization in rainfed conditions, and the least Δ13C was found for the one with N Fertilization and irrigation. The Δ13C measurement was effective in identifying N and water deficiencies, presenting potential to be used as an indicator of N and water limitations for sugarcane yield © 2021.

Rust fungi are among the most devastating diseases for economically important crops around the world. Here, we report the complete sequence and annotation of the mitochondrial genome of Austropuccinia psidii (syn. Puccinia psidii), the causal agent of myrtle rust. We performed a phylogenomic analysis including the complete mitochondrial sequences from other rust fungi. The genome composed of 93.299 bp has 73 predicted genes, 33 of which encoded nonconserved proteins (ncORFs), representing almost 45% of all predicted genes. A. psidii mtDNA is one of the largest rust mtDNA sequenced to date, most likely due to the abundance of ncORFs. Among them, 33% were within intronic regions of diverse intron groups. Mobile genetic elements invading intron sequences may have played significant roles in size but not shaping of the rust mitochondrial genome structure. The mtDNAs from rust fungi are highly syntenic. Phylogenetic inferences with 14 concatenated mitochondrial proteins encoded by the core genes placed A. psidii according to phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rDNA. Interestingly, cox1, the gene with the greatest number of introns, provided phylogenies not congruent with the core set. For the first time, we identified the proteins encoded by three A. psidii ncORFs using proteomics analyses. Also, the orf208 encoded a transmembrane protein repressed during in vitro morphogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, we presented the first report of a complete mtDNA sequence of a member of the family Sphaerophragmiacea. Copyright: © 2021 de Almeida et al.

Particularly, aerobic methanotrophs showed significantly stimulated growth and activity in the presence of accompanying microorganisms in an interaction network (interactome). Yet, little is known of how the interactome responds to disturbances, and how community functioning is affected by the disturbance-induced structuring of the interaction network. Here, we employed a time-series stable isotope probing (SIP) approach using 13C–CH4 coupled to a co-occurrence network analysis after Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 13C-enriched 16S rRNA gene to directly relate the response in methanotrophic activity to the network structure of the interactome after desiccation-rewetting of a paddy soil. Methane uptake rate decreased immediately (<5 days) after short-term desiccation-rewetting. Although the methanotroph subgroups differentially responded to desiccation-rewetting, the metabolically active bacterial community composition, including the methanotrophs, recovered after the disturbance. However, the interaction network was profoundly altered, becoming more complex but, less modular after desiccation-rewetting, despite the recovery in the methanotrophic activity and community composition/abundances. This suggests that the legacy of the disturbance persists in the interaction network. The change in the network structure may have consequences for community functioning with recurring desiccation-rewetting. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

These processes are partially controlled by soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity, in process-based models described by analytical functions (K-θ-h) that define the dependence between pressure head (h), soil water content (θ) and hydraulic conductivity (K). Given the nonlinearity of these process-based SVAT models, stochastic analysis is an interesting tool to get insight in the pattern of model outputs given the uncertainty in the K–θ–h functions. We developed a stochastic framework to evaluate outputs of the SWAP hydrological model according to the uncertainty in the van Genuchten-Mualem K–θ–h analytical functions (VGM). A multivariate Gaussian joint distribution analysis stochastically sampled VGM parameters using two statistical methods, one considering and one disregarding parameter correlations. We evaluated the relations of VGM parameters and simulation outputs (i) for an internal drainage scenario to predict pressure head at flux-based field capacity and (ii) for a cropped scenario to predict water balance components. We also assessed the relative importance of each parameter using linear regression and random forest methods. The hydrological stochastic simulations showed that the developed algorithm allowed to perform multiple SWAP model runs in a quick and unassisted manner on a common personal computer. Although the degree of VGM uncertainty of the studied soils did not affect the SWAP simulation results considerably, model output uncertainty increased when uncorrelated stochastic realizations of VGM parameters were used. The relative propagation of parameter uncertainty showed to be dependent on the simulated scenario (boundary conditions) and on the soil itself. For the correlated VGM stochastic realizations, both criteria used to analyze the parameter importance detected the VGM parameter l as one of the most relevant in determining water balance components variation. This is an interesting outcome, as this parameter is hardly ever determined, and commonly assumed to a predefined value. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Whereas most of it results from natural geochemical processes, an estimated 30% of irrigated lands globally are salt-affected through secondary human-induced salinization. Application of lower quality, alternative irrigation water is further threatening expansion of the areal extent of soil salinity, in addition to climate change causing increases of salt-water intrusion in coastal areas and increasing crop water requirements. The reduced availability of freshwater resources for irrigation, the continued reduction of the world's cultivated agricultural area by land degradation and urbanization, in conjunction with a growing world population further complicates the problem seeking sustainable solutions. This scoping review prioritizes critical knowledge gaps and makes recommendations for 10 priorities in soil salinity research toward a sustainable and productive agricultural system for a food-secure future world. We also include basin-specific case studies that illustrate progress of the world's major irrigated areas in addressing impacts of soil salinization. By identifying research priorities, we seek to accelerate enhanced research funding to bring new knowledge and innovative solutions toward mitigation of soil salinity impacts. We further want to inspire the science community to develop new directions in salinity research. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.	Book chapter	Scopus

The first phytocystatin described was isolated from Oryza sativa and, since then, cystatins from several plant species were reported, including from sugarcane. Sugarcane cystatins were unraveled in Sugarcane EST project database, after sequencing of cDNA libraries from various sugarcane tissues at different developmental stages and six sugarcane cystatins were cloned, expressed and characterized (CaneCPI-1 to CaneCPI-6). These recombinant proteins were produced in different expression systems and inhibited several cysteine proteases, including human cathepsins B and L, which can be involved in pathologies, such as cancer. In this review, we summarize a comprehensive history of all sugarcane cystatins, presenting an updated phylogenetic analysis; chromosomal localization, and genomic organization. We also present protein docking of CaneCPI-5 in the active site of human cathepsin B, insights about canecystatins structures; recombinant expression in different systems, comparison of their inhibitory activities against human cysteine cathepsins B, K, L, S, V, falcipains from Plasmodium falciparum and a cathepsin L-like from the sugarcane weevil Sphenophorus levis; and enlighten their potential and current applications in agriculture and health. © 2020	Review	Scopus

However, the development of useful pseudo-natural nitrones requires the judicious choice of a secondary metabolite as the precursor. Betalains are nitrogen-containing natural pigments that exhibit marked antioxidant capacity and pharmacological properties and, hence, are ideal candidates for designing multifunctional nitrones. In this work, we describe the semisynthesis and properties of a biocompatible and antioxidant betalain-nitrone called OxiBeet. This bio-based compound is a better radical scavenger than ascorbic acid, gallic acid, and most non-phenolic antioxidants and undergoes concerted proton-coupled electron transfer. The autoxidation of OxiBeet produces a persistent nitroxide radical, which, herein, is studied via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that excited state formation is not required for the oxidation of OxiBeet. The results are compared with those obtained using betanin, a natural betalain, and pBeet, the imine analog of OxiBeet. The findings of this study will enable the development of antioxidant and spin-trap nitrones based on the novel N-oxide 1,7-diazaheptamethinium scaffold and betalain dyes with enhanced hydrolytic stability in aqueous alkaline media. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

In the root of Arabidopsis thaliana, maturation of the ground tissue (GT)—a tissue comprising all cells between epidermal and vascular ones—is a paradigmatic example of these modifications, as it generates an additional tissue layer, the middle cortex (MC).1–4 In early post-embryonic phases, the Arabidopsis root GT is composed of one layer of endodermis and one of cortex. A second cortex layer, the MC, is generated by asymmetric cell divisions in about 80% of Arabidopsis primary roots, in a time window spanning from 7 to 14 days post-germination (dpg). The cell cycle regulator CYCLIN D6;1 (CYCD6;1) plays a central role in this process, as its accumulation in the endodermis triggers the formation of MC.5 The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) is a key regulator of the timing of MC formation, as alterations in its signaling and homeostasis result in precocious endodermal asymmetric cell divisions.3,6,7 However, little is known on how GAs are regulated during GT maturation. Here, we show that the HOMEODOMAIN LEUCINE ZIPPER III (HD-ZIPIII) transcription factor PHABULOSA (PHB) is a master regulator of MC formation, controlling the accumulation of CYCD6;1 in the endodermis in a cell non-autonomous manner. We show that PHB activates the GA catabolic gene GIBBERELLIN 2 OXIDASE 2 (GA2ox2) in the vascular tissue, thus regulating the stability of the DELLA protein GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE (GAI)—a GA signaling repressor—in the root and, hence, CYCD6;1 expression in the endodermis. © 2020 The Authors; Bertolotti, Unterholzner et al. show that a time-dependent threshold of the transcription factor PHB governs the timing of middle cortex formation in the Arabidopsis root. PHB promotes CYCD6;1 expression in the endodermis cell non-autonomously by reducing gibberellin (GA) levels in the vascular tissue and, hence, stabilizing the GAs repressor GAI. © 2020 The Authors	Article	Scopus

Soil with bound residues of three herbicides and fresh soil samples were added to the biometric flasks, followed by the addition of vinasse, filter cake, or sugarcane straw in order to reactivate the microbial activity. In sandy loam soil, higher mineralization was observed where filter cake was added, and the maximum mineralized percentage was 7.7, 46.7, and 8.1% of diuron-, hexazinone-, and metribuzin-bound residues, respectively. Conversely, this soil presented a greater percentage of re-extractable hexazinone and metribuzin residues when vinasse was added. Among the examined herbicides, a higher percentage of bound metribuzin residues remained in the soil (57.5–75.6%). It was possible to identify both metabolites and parent compounds in the re-extracted residues, implying either species could bind to the soil. Therefore, this study has shown that bound residues of three herbicides and their metabolites can become bioavailable, and mineralized or returned to the soil solution, which could adversely affect subsequent crops or non-target organisms. Hence, the remobilization of bound residues must be taken into account when assessing the environmental risk of herbicides in soils in registration processes. © 2020, Society for Sugar Research & Promotion.

It is a native Brazilian species of great economic and social importance, particularly in the Amazon region. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is the main challenge for this crop. Therefore, the present study verified whether C. siamense, an endophytic fungus infected with a mycovirus, could protect the seedlings and reduce or eliminate the characteristic symptoms. Total proteins and enzymatic activities of pathogenesis-related proteins (PRPs), including peroxidase (POX), chitinase (CHI), and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), were quantified. Guarana seedlings of cultivar Maués were sprayed with a C. siamense conidia suspension (5.0 × 103 conidia/mL). After ten days, the seedlings were sprayed with a suspension of the phytopathogen's conidia (1.0 × 106 conidia/mL). One group of these seedlings received the fungicide indicated for this crop. The fungicide was applied twice with an interval of 15 days between applications. Negative control seedlings did not receive any treatment (except water and fertilization), and positive control seedlings were treated only with the phytopathogen. The experiment was conducted between December 2019 and February 2020 in a greenhouse. The treatments were applied at an average temperature of 25°C and 85% relative humidity. Leaflets were randomly collected from each treatment group at 0, 48, 72, and 96 hours after pathogen inoculation and analyzed for total protein and enzyme production (POX, PAL, and CHI). After 28 days, the percentage of leaf lesions on the seedlings was evaluated. C. siamense inoculation reduced lesions. There were differences in total proteins and PRPs at different timepoints after inoculation, except for CHI activity, among treatments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of resistance induction in guarana plants. © 2021 Luana L. Casas et al.	Article	Scopus

The present study compared univariate and multivariate strategies to investigate the elements detected with μ-XRF during soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) germination. The conventional approach, i.e., univariate, showed that the studied micronutrients (Mn, Fe, and Zn) were located mainly on the radicle tip, while the macronutrients (P, S, K, and Ca) were spread through the seed. The score maps, as well the correlation maps from a covariance matrix, were able to evaluate variations of chemical elements, such as P, S, K, Ca, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Rh-scattering effects through the embryo, leading the first glance at elemental distribution and remobilization during soybean seed germination. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Recent advances in gene editing technology, such as base editors and prime-editing, coupled with a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of domestication delivered by the analysis of crop ‘pangenomes’, open the exciting prospect of creating novel crops via manipulation of domestication-related genes in wild species. A de novo domestication platform may allow rapid and precise conversion of crop wild relatives into crops, while retaining many of the valuable resilience and nutritional traits left behind during domestication and breeding. Using the Solanaceae family as case in point, we discuss how such a knowledge-driven pipeline could be exploited to contribute to food security over the coming decades. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	Review	Scopus

This is also the case for most cave studies from tropical South America, where many new δ18O stalagmite records covering the last millennia were recently published. Here, we review the δ13C values in stalagmites, investigating the influence on this proxy of local hydroclimate, altitude, temperature and vegetation types, by employing a new dataset composed of published and unpublished carbon isotope records from various sites in tropical South America. The main factors influencing δ13C values are associated with the local hydroclimate, followed by minor effects from temperature. Most of the isotopic records show a significant correlation between the δ13C and δ18O values, indicating a close relationship between local hydroclimate and atmospheric convective processes related to the South American Monsoon System. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

The fractionation between 12C and 13C mainly occurs during photosynthesis, which preferentially incorporates 12C into organic molecules and controls δ13C values of large extents of the biosphere and other materials. For example, the isotopic signature of plants is transferred to soils and later to cave speleothems and/or sediments carried by rivers and deposited in the oceans. Another example is the photosynthesis performed by marine algae, which affects the isotopic signature of seawater that is also transferred to carbonate shells of marine organisms, such as foraminifera. Thus, δ13C values from these materials (i.e., organic molecules, speleothems, foraminifera) are closely related to the climatic and environmental conditions occurring at their site of formation. In this review, we summarize the dynamics of δ13C in plants, soils, rocks and oceans to show how these carbon reservoirs can document present and past climatic and environmental conditions, and therefore, provide important information about biologic and geologic processes. The examples shown in this paper are mainly derived from paleoclimatic and paleoenvironment studies performed in the Brazilian territory and the adjacent ocean. © The Author(s) 2021.	Article	Scopus

The procedure involved the reaction of diphenylthiocarbazone (dithizone) with Zn(II) in the alkaline medium and extraction with chloroform. The instrumental setup, combined with flow-batch and multicommuted flow analyses approaches, was designed to facilitate microextraction without using a dispersant organic solvent. Fluid propulsion occurred through two mini peristaltic pumps and a homemade syringe pump. Photometric detection was performed using a homemade LED-based photometer equipped with a flow cell (50 mm in length). The control of the instrumental setup, analytical procedure, and data acquisition algorithm was achieved using an Arduino Due board along with a software developed for this study. After determining the optimal values of the control variables using Zn(II) standard solutions, the effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated. For this purpose, a set of water samples was analyzed. For assessing accuracy, the samples were also analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). By comparing the paired t-test results of the two analyses, it was observed that at 95% confidence level, there is no significant difference. Other advantageous results of the proposed method were as follows: the linear response range was 10–100 µgL−1 (r2 = 0.9934), the limit of detection was 8.3 µgL−1, the coefficient of variation was 3.3% (n = 9), the consumption of chloroform and dithizone was 200 µL and 4 µg, respectively, per determination, and the sampling rate was 19 determinations per hour. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Their degradation is often closely related to microbial metabolism. However, the impacts of soil bacterial community on sulfadiazine (SDZ) dissipation remains unclear, mainly in tropical soils. Our main goals were to evaluate effects of long-term swine manure application on soil bacterial structure as well as effects of soil microbial diversity depletion on SDZ dissipation, using “extinction dilution approach” and 14C-SDZ. Manure application affected several soil attributes, such as pH, organic carbon (OC), and macronutrient contents as well as bacterial community structure and diversity. Even minor bacterial diversity depletion impacted SDZ mineralization and non-extractible residue (NER) formation rates, but NER recovered along 42 d likely due to soil diversity recovery. However, this period may be enough to spread resistance genes into the environment. Surprisingly, the non-manured natural soil (NS–S1) showed faster SDZ dissipation rate (DT90 = 2.0 versus 21 d) and had a great number of bacterial families involved in major SDZ dissipation pathways (mineralization and mainly NER), such as Isosphaeraceae, Ktedonobacteraceae, Acidobacteriaceae_(Subgroup_1), Micromonosporaceae, and Sphingobacteriaceae. This result is unique and contrasts our hypothesis that long-term manured soils would present adaptive advantages and, consequently, have higher SDZ dissipation rates. The literature suggests instantaneous chemical degradation of SDZ in acidic soils responsible to the fast formation of NER. Our results show that if chemical degradation happens, it is soon followed by microbial metabolism (biodegradation) performed by a pool of bacteria and the newly formed metabolites should favors NER formation since SDZ presented low sorption. It also showed that SDZ mineralization is a low redundancy function. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

At this regard, both warming and drought might affect the nutrient use efficiency (NUE) and growth of Megathyrsus maximus a C4 forage grass of high interest for cattle feeding. However, the nutrient requirements of this species under climate change are unknown. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the individual and combined effects of two levels of temperature: ambient and elevated temperature (2°C above ambient temperature), and two levels of soil water availability: irrigated plants and non-irrigated plants on accumulation of leaf nutrients, NUE and biomass production of M. maximus. Temperature control was performed by a temperature free-air-controlled enhancement (T-FACE) system under field conditions. In general, we observed that warming under well-irrigated conditions increased the leaf accumulation of most nutrients, improving the NUE of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Mn and Zn. Plant growth was also enhanced under warming effects, with higher leaf dry mass accumulation and root development. Meanwhile, drought decreased NUE of K, Ca, B and leaf dry biomass, while root growth was stimulated. The combined effects of warming and drought on nutrient accumulation, NUE and plant growth tended to be greater than the individual effects expected from a single factor; thus, warming mitigated the negative impacts of individual drought. In summary, our findings suggest that warming and drought, both as individual and combined factors, will change the nutrient requirements of M. maximus in tropical ecosystems. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH	Article	Scopus

The type material was collected by Roberto Burle-Marx, who introduced it into cultivation in his gardens, but lacking the accurate provenance, only mentioning that it was collected between Milagres and Amargosa municipalities. It was later described by Pereira & Moutinho based on a cultivated specimen. In this work, we present new specimens found in natural populations in an area that coincides with the type locality description, enabling us to expand the description of the species, as well as to provide images of the living plants in the field, adding information about its habitat. The herbarium collections revision and the new population found in the field enabled us to propose an updated conservation status and to better characterize the habit, plant architecture, and to add new morphological comparisons and geographical distribution. © 2021, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

These techniques were combined with principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate the chemical composition on the surface and depth profiling of PCB samples. The spatial distribution of important base metals (e.g. Al, Au, Ba, Cu, Fe, Mg, Ni, Zn), toxic elements (e.g. Cd, Cr, Pb) as well as the non-metallic fraction (e.g. P, S and Si) from conductive tracks, solder mask and integrated components were detected within the PCB samples. Univariate and multivariate approaches were also performed to obtain calibration models for Cu determination. The results were compared to reference concentrations obtained by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) after microwave-assisted acid leaching using aqua regia. To this end, two PCB samples (50 × 34 mm2) were cut into small parts of 40 subsamples (10 × 8.5 mm2) and analyzed by ICP-OES and the Cu concentrations ranged from 13 to 45% m m−1. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to data fusion of analytical information from LIBS and micro-XRF analysis. The proposed calibration methods for LIBS and micro-XRF were tested for the 40 PCB subsamples, in which the best results were obtained combining both data sources though a low-level data fusion. Root mean square error of cross validation (RMSEC) and recoveries were 3.23% m m−1 and 81–119% using leave-one-out cross validation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Some macrophyte species may interfere with the availability of herbicides in water, increasing dissipation in this environment. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the absorption and dissipation of 14C-saflufenacil in water by Egeria densa and Pistia stratiotes. Dissipation was performed with 14C-saflufenacil applied directly in water and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry (LSS). The evaluation times were 0, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after application (HAA) for E. densa and 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 84 and 108 HAA for P. stratiotes. Absorption was analyzed through plant combustion in a biological oxidizer. The presence of the macrophytes increased the dissipation of 14C-saflufenacil in water. The half-life time (DT50) of the herbicide decreased by 82.6% in the presence of E. densa at 96 HAA. For P. stratiotes, the reduction in DT50 was 94.8% at 108 HAA. The absorption of 14C-saflufenacil was low for both macrophytes during the evaluated time. However, the macrophytes E. densa and P. stratiotes showed potential for the phytoremediation of water contaminated with saflufenacil. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	Article	Scopus

Consequently, alternatives for gossypol destruction must be evaluated. This work evaluated the emerging technology of ozone processing for free gossypol destruction in cottonseed meal. Ozonation was carried out in the actual cottonseed meal and also a model system, designed to describe the involved mode of action. The model system consisted of glass pearls beads covered with free gossypol. Ozonation was performed in two ways: as a static process, i.e., without homogenising the sample after placing them in the reactor, and also homogenising it. Ozone degraded free gossypol in all the systems, but reaching different levels. Free gossypol reduction was higher in the model system than the cottonseed meal, and higher in the homogenised processing than the static one: cottonseed meal in homogenised (56%) and static (25%); model system homogenised (98%) and static (80%). The obtained differences suggest a problem of gas penetration in the solid particles, the effect of unexposed surfaces due to contact areas, and the reaction with other organic molecules further than the target. Ozonation is a promising technique for gossypol degradation in cottonseed meal, but additional strategies are needed to optimise the ozonation process and evaluate toxicological aspects. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

While temperate regions concentrate the largest number of studies involving pXRF for soil characterization, tropical regions have recently demonstrated increasing interests in—and acceptance of—pXRF applications for soil-related studies due to the wide range of purposes in which this equipment can be utilized. However, the lack of a standard methodology for tropical soil analysis via pXRF coupled with the recognized variation of results according to the procedures used during analyses underlie the need for routine protocols for improving pXRF analyses in tropical environments. Besides establishing such a standard methodology, this review elucidates the main differences between soils from tropical and temperate regions that are key in pXRF research, presents state-of-the-art achievements in pXRF analysis, and envisions applications of pXRF in tropical soils. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

It is known that this type of LUC impacts soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics, particularly labile carbon (C) pools (living and non-living), decreasing soil health and agricultural sustainability, as well as increasing soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and accelerating global climate change. In this study, we quantified the changes in the quantity and quality of SOM and GHG fluxes due to changes in land use and cropland management in the Brazilian Cerrado. The land uses studied were native vegetation (NV), pasture (PA) and four croplands, including the following management types: conventional tillage with a single soybean crop (CT), and three no-tillage systems with two crops cultivated in the same year (i.e., soybean/sorghum (NTSSo), soybean/millet (NTSMi) and maize/sorghum (NTMSo)). Soil and gases were sampled in the rainy season (November, December and January) and dry season (May, July and September). The highest soil C and nitrogen (N) stocks (6.7 kg C m−2 and 0.5 kg N m−2, 0–0.3-m layer) were found under NV. LUC reduced C stocks by 25% in the CT and by 10% in the PA and NT. Soil N stocks were 30% lower in the PA and NTMSo and 15% lower in the croplands with soybean compared to NV. δ13C values clearly distinguished between the C-origin from NV (−25‰) and that from other land uses (−16‰). Soil (0–0.1 m) under NV also presented higher labile-C (625 g C m−2), microbial-C (70 g C m−2) and microbial-N (5.5 g N m−2), whereas other land uses presented values three times lower. GHG emissions (expressed as C-equivalent) were highest in the NV (1.2 kg m−2 year−1), PA (1.3 kg m−2 year−1) and NTMSo (0.9 kg m−2 year−1) and were positively related to the higher SOM turnover in these systems. Our results suggest that in order to maintain SOM, it is necessary to adopt “best” management practices, that provide large plant residue inputs (above- and belowground). This can be seen as a pathway to achieving high food production with low GHG emissions. © 2020 British Society of Soil Science	Article	Scopus

Several technological advances have contributed to the implementation of different proteomics approaches for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the dynamics of cellular responses at the protein level. The design of time-resolved experiments and the emergent use of multiplexed proteome analysis using chemical or isotopic and isobaric labeling strategies as well as label-free approaches are generating a vast amount of proteomics data that is going to be essential for analysis of protein posttranslational modifications and implementation of systems biology approaches. Through the target proteomics analysis, especially the ones that combine the untargeted methods, we should expect an improvement in the completeness of the identification of proteome and reveal nuances of regulatory cellular mechanisms related to plant development and responses to environmental stresses. Both genomic sequencing and proteomic advancements in the last decades coupled to integrative data analysis are enriching biological information that was once confined to model plants. Therewith, predictions of a changing environment places proteomics as an especially useful tool for crops performance. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	Book chapter	Scopus

Although many studies have evaluated the effects of deforestation on the microbiome, its effect on the soil resistome remains unknown. Considering that antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are a threat to global health and food security, here we evaluated how land-use change in the Amazon region impacts the soil resistome. Our analysis revealed that several antibiotic resistance mechanisms and genes are common to both the native forest and the altered areas; however, deforestation and subsequent conversion to other land-use systems increased the diversity and abundance of these genes. The enrichment of ARGs is correlated to increased microbial diversity in response to deforestation, along with changes in soil chemical properties, such as pH and aluminum. Our findings demonstrated that Amazon deforestation enriched ARGs in soil and how anthropogenic disturbances may exert selective pressure on the microbial communities expanding the soil resistome. Further investigation is still needed to understand if the ARGs can be transferred via the food chains (e.g. agricultural soils) to humans, jeopardizing antibiotic treatment effectiveness and compromising public health. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

However, it is unclear how grazing exclusion reduces the negative effects of overgrazing on the microbial community in the Caatinga biome. In our study, we assessed the bacterial community under three different soil managements in a semiarid region of the Brazilian Caatinga biome, as follows: (a) Native Caatinga vegetation (natural); (b) grazing exclusion (exclusion); and (c) overgrazing (grazed). The bacterial community was assessed through the sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and analyzed soil chemical and physical properties were correlated with the bacterial community structure. Our results demonstrate that exclusion increases the content of soil carbon and nitrogen, and bacterial diversity, while grazed showed a reduction of ~31 and ~43% in organic C, compared to exclusion and natural, respectively. However, the changes in bacterial diversity were more expressive in a specific site (No. 1), suggesting that exclusion strategy could be a context-dependent and complex approach to protecting or improving Caatinga soils. Moreover, grazed areas might restrain the potential of bacterial diversity to sustain ecosystem functions since nonbeneficial elements increased in grazed treatments, which presented a negative correlation with the bacterial community. Our study provides novel evidence that high-intensity disturbance by overgrazing could not only reduce soil fertility but it may also restrain bacterial composition, with implications on ecosystem functioning. The Caatinga soil microbiome may be unable to maintain ecosystem services such as plant and animals' development under overgrazing management. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	Article	Scopus

A better understanding of the soil microbiome and the relationship between microbial diversity and environmental parameters would increase our ability to set conservation priorities. In recent years, ecotones have been considered an important issue in ecological studies since they are ecosystems located in the transition between two biomes where communities meet and integrate. Here, we hypothesized that each area of the environmental gradient Cerrado-Ecotone-Caatinga would harbor a distinct bacterial community mainly shaped by the differential environmental factors. To test this hypothesis, the bacterial community was assessed using the 16S rRNA gene sequencing and correlated with environmental parameters. Our analysis revealed that each area presented a distinct community structure and composition that was related to changes in environmental parameters such as pH, Al, and temperature. Although we did not find significant differences in the microbial diversity, the network analysis showed a gradient with a decreased complexity from the Cerrado to Caatinga also as a response of the soil characteristics, with changes in the number of correlations and the proportion of co-occurrence and competition. Also, the compositional analysis revealed that the most abundant bacterial group in each area is related to functional adaptation to soil properties. Overall, our findings expand our knowledge about the microbiome of these areas and add important information that can be suitable for future ecosystem exploration and the development of preservation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is still a poorly studied area within precision agriculture. Thus, the objective of this research was to evaluate the correlation of soil physicochemical attributes with the sorption and desorption processes of hexazinone and tebuthiuron to support application maps considering the field level variability. Soil samples from an agricultural area had their physicochemical attributes analyzed and were submitted to sorption and desorption studies of 14C-tebuthiuron and 14C-hexazinone using the batch equilibrium method. The values of sorption and desorption apparent coefficients (Kd), sorption and desorption percentage and bioavailability were correlated with soil attributes by Pearson's correlation. The Kd values of tebuthiuron and hexazinone sorption ranged from 1.2 to 2.9 mL g−1 and 0.4–0.6 mL g−1, respectively. For desorption of tebuthiuron and hexazinone, Kd values ranged from 3.4 to 4.4 mL g−1 and 2.6–3.0 mL g−1, respectively. A positive correlation among clay content, soil organic matter (OM), and tebuthiuron and hexazinone sorption Kd values were found. Both herbicides had variable retention according to geographic position in the area. The recommendation of application of PRE herbicides, such as tebuthiuron and hexazinone, observing the physicochemical attributes of the soil is an alternative to increase efficiency in weed control and decrease the risk of environmental contamination. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Feed was provided twice a day; animal weighing along with body condition scoring occurred within a 14-day interval. The lambs were slaughtered at the end of the performance test. Analysis of variance was performed through the Mixed procedure of the SAS, as well as linear and quadratic regression analysis. The groups presented differences between the treatments (P <0.05) for dry matter intake (DMI), ethereal extract intake (EEI), consumption in relation to live weight percentage and feed conversion ratio (FCR). The lowest mean DMI was obtained by the animals that received the M2 and differed from the C treatment, whose average was the highest. The EEI was highest for the M3 group and the FCR was also better for this group. There was a linear effect for EEI and FCR, and quadratic for crude protein intake. There was no effect for carcass characteristics, and only initial pH had a decreasing linear effect. The macadamia nut cake was effective in promoting the performance of the animals, since there was an improvement in feed conversion. © 2021, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias. All rights reserved.

The objectives of this study were to determine the N contribution from fertilizer and soil to wheat and corn grown in rotation and the residual N contribution from fertilizer applied to wheat and carried over to corn under Brazilian savannah conditions. This study was established in a no-till system on Rhodic Haplustox soil in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The N treatments applied to the wheat crops were 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 160 kg (urea-15N) ha−1. The residual effects of N on the succeeding corn crop were evaluated. During the corn phase, two additional treatments were included: a control (0 N) and a treatment with 160 kg N ha−1. Regression analysis showed that the highest estimated wheat yield (5415 kg ha−1) was observed with the application of 114 kg N ha−1. Significant effects from the residual N were observed in the corn shoot biomass and straw N uptake. On average, the recovery rate of the urea N fertilizer was 34% for wheat, and the residual urea N fertilizer use in corn (when applied to wheat) was less than 5% of the amount initially applied. The effect of the residual N was not enough to meet the N demands of the succeeding corn crop. The results of this study provide producers and the scientific community with good estimates of nitrogen use efficiency for wheat and corn. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

However, data on API occurrence in Brazilian surface freshwaters are still scarce. The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) provides several medicines free-of-charge, including medications that have bezafibrate, fluoxetine and levothyroxine as the API. Thus, our objective was to investigate the occurrence of bezafibrate, fluoxetine and levothyroxine in samples collected at sampling sites included in the surface freshwater monitoring program of the São Paulo State Environmental Agency (CETESB); caffeine was also included in the analysis because it is commonly used as an anthropogenic marker of aquatic environment contamination. Monitoring results showed that levothyroxine was not found in any of the analysed samples. Caffeine was ubiquitous in the analysed samples, thus indicating anthropic contamination in the studied water bodies. Caffeine and bezafibrate presented risk quotient (RQ) < 1 for all the sampling sites and periods evaluated in this study. For fluoxetine, RQs > 1 were found in all water samples in which this API was found, indicating a potential risk for freshwater pelagic biota. Thus, fluoxetine should be regulated in São Paulo State in order to protect the aquatic biota. Additional occurrence studies in other Brazilian states are still needed to evaluate if fluoxetine is a nationwide pollutant. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

However, the polyphasic approach applied nowadays to investigate the cyanobacterial diversity has emerged as a powerful tool to undercover cryptic taxa and to set up a more natural classification system. Yet, studies exploring the cultured diversity of cyanobacteria from extreme tropical environments have paved the way to the discovery of new cyanobacteria taxa, enabling the description of Pantanalinema, Alkalinema, and Cephalothrix as novel genera from saline–alkaline lakes in Pantanal wetlands (Brazil). The present study investigated a set of cyanobacterial strains resembling Leptolyngbya morphotypes by means of its morphology, 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) phylogeny, and ITS secondary structures. Based on the shape and structure of their trichomes, the low levels of 16S rRNA identity coupled with the distinct phylogenetic position with regard to well establish genera, and their divergent ecological feature, these strains must be accommodated into a novel genus, named as Monilinema gen. nov., described under the provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. Accordingly, based on the singularity of the D1–D1′ and V3 helixes, these strains should be considered as a single species, Monilinema alkalinum. © 2020 Phycological Society of America	Article	Scopus

Here, we explored the cost-effectiveness and drivers of aboveground and soil carbon accumulation in restored forests across an agricultural landscape of Brazil's Atlantic Forest. The recovery of aboveground and soil carbon stocks, as well as the implementation and land opportunity costs, was assessed across chronosequences (10–60 years) of second-growth forests and mixed-species tree plantings and old growth, reference forest remnants. Plantations accumulated approximately 50% more aboveground carbon than second-growth forests throughout the chronosequence. When controlling for soil clay content, soil carbon stocks were higher in reference than in restored forests, but they were comparable between plantations and second-growth forests. After 60 years of stand development, recovery of total carbon stocks in both restoration approaches reached only half of the average stocks of reference forests. Total cost-effectiveness for carbon accumulation, including both implementation and land opportunity costs, was on average 60% higher for second-growth forests than for plantations (15.1 and 9.4 kgC US$−1, respectively). Although tree plantations initially showed higher rates of carbon storage than second-growth forests, their higher implementation and land opportunity costs make them less cost-effective for carbon farming. Our results further suggest that, at current pricing levels, carbon markets alone have a limited potential to up-scale restoration efforts in Brazil's Atlantic Forest. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The individual and combined performance of visible and near infrared (VNIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was assessed for predicting clay, organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, base saturation (V), and extractable (ex-) nutrients in tropical soils. A set of 102 samples, collected from two agricultural fields, with broad ranges of fertility attributes were selected. Two contrasting data fusion approaches have been applied for modeling: (i) merging spectral data of different sensors followed by partial least squares regression (PLS), known as fusion before prediction; and (ii) applying the Granger and Ramanathan (GR) averaging approach, known as fusion after prediction. Results showed VNIR as individual technique to be the best for the prediction of clay and OM content (2.61 ≤ residual prediction deviation (RPD) ≤ 3.37), while the chemical attributes CEC, V, ex-P, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg were better predicted (1.82 ≤ RPD ≤ 4.82) by elemental analysis techniques (i.e., XRF and LIBS). Only pH cannot be predicted regardless the technique. The attributes OM, V, and ex-P were best predicted using single-sensor approaches, while the attributes clay, CEC, pH, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg were overall best predicted using multi-sensor approaches. Regarding the performance of the multi-sensor approaches, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg, were best predicted (RPD of 4.98, 5.30, and 4.11 for ex-K, ex-Ca and ex-Mg, respectively) using two-sensor fusion approach (VNIR + XRF for ex-K and XRF + LIBS for ex-Ca and ex-Mg), while clay, CEC and pH were best predicted (RPD of 4.02, 2.63, and 1.32 for clay, CEC, and pH, respectively) with the three-sensor fusion approach (VNIR + XRF + LIBS). Therefore, the best combination of sensors for predicting key fertility attributes proved to be attribute-specific, which is a drawback of the data fusion approach. The present work is pioneering in highlighting benefits and limitations of the in tandem application of VNIR, XRF, and LIBS spectroscopies for fertility analysis in tropical soils. © 2021 by the authors.

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of the highest IMI concentration detected in surface water (320.0 µg L−1) on the survival of Chironomus sancticaroli, Daphnia similis, and Danio rerio in three different scenarios of water contamination. The enzymatic activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in D. rerio also were determined. For this evaluation, we have simulated a lotic environment using an indoor system of artificial channels developed for the present study. In this system, three scenarios of contamination by IMI (320.0 µg L−1) were reproduced: one using reconstituted water (RW) and the other two using water samples collected in unpolluted (UW) and polluted (DW) areas of a river. The results indicated that the tested concentration was not able to cause mortality in D. similis and D. rerio in any proposed treatment (RW, UW, and DW). However, C. sancticaroli showed 100% of mortality in the presence of IMI in the three proposed treatments, demonstrating its potential to impact the community of aquatic nontarget insects negatively. Low IMI concentrations did not offer risks to D. rerio survival. However, we observed alterations in GST, CAT, and APX activities in treatments that used IMI and water with no evidence of pollution (i.e., RW and UW). These last results demonstrated that fish are more susceptible to the effects of IMI in unpolluted environments. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	Article	Scopus

Peat mining adversely affects methanotrophs, but activity and community composition/abundances may recover after restoration. Considering that the methanotrophic activity and growth are significantly stimulated in the presence of other microorganisms, the methane-driven interaction network, which encompasses methanotrophs and nonmethanotrophs (i.e., the methanotrophic interactome), may also be relevant in conferring community resilience. Yet, little is known of the methanotrophic interactome's response to and recovery from disturbances. Here, we determined the recovery of the methanotrophic interactome as inferred by a co-occurrence network analysis comparing pristine and restored peatlands. We coupled a DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) approach using [13C]CH4 to a co-occurrence network analysis derived from the 13C-enriched 16S rRNA gene sequences to relate the response in methanotrophic activity to the structuring of the interaction network. Methanotrophic activity and abundances recovered after peat restoration since 2000. “Methylomonaceae” taxa were the predominantly active methanotrophs in both peatlands, but the peatlands differed in the relative abundances of Methylacidiphilaceae and Methylocystis. However, bacterial community compositions were distinct in both peatlands. Likewise, the methanotrophic interactome was profoundly altered in the restored peatland. Structuring of the interaction network after peat mining resulted in the loss of complexity and modularity, indicating a less connected and efficient network, which may have consequences in the event of recurring/future disturbances. Therefore, determining the response of the methane-driven interaction network, in addition to relating methanotrophic activity to community composition/abundances, provided a more comprehensive understanding of the resilience of the methanotrophs. © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

Rainforest-to-pasture conversion stimulates the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The biotic methane cycle is driven by microorganisms; therefore, this study focused on active methane-cycling microorganisms and their functions across land-use types. We collected intact soil cores from three land use types (primary rainforest, pasture, and secondary rainforest) of two geographically distinct areas of the Brazilian Amazon (Santarém, Pará and Ariquemes, Rondônia) and performed DNA stable-isotope probing coupled with metagenomics to identify the active methanotrophs and methanogens. At both locations, we observed a significant change in the composition of the isotope-labeled methane-cycling microbial community across land use types, specifically an increase in the abundance and diversity of active methanogens in pastures. We conclude that a significant increase in the abundance and activity of methanogens in pasture soils could drive increased soil methane emissions. Furthermore, we found that secondary rainforests had decreased methanogenic activity similar to primary rainforests, and thus a potential to recover as methane sinks, making it conceivable for forest restoration to offset greenhouse gas emissions in the tropics. These findings are critical for informing land management practices and global tropical rainforest conservation. © 2020, The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

Propolis is considered as an effective enhancer of rumen fermentation and the whole animal health conditions in growing and dairy cattle; however no study has confirmed these positive effects in late pregnant ewes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effects of supplementing red propolis extract (RPE) on apparent digestibility, purine derivatives, methane (CH4) emission and blood metabolites of late pregnant ewes. Eighteen Santa Inês ewes (52.5 ± 2.50 kg body weight) were kept individually in indoor pens. The trail lasted for 44 d of which 14 d were for adaptation and 30 d for data collection. Ewes were allotted into a randomized complete block design (9 blocks × 2 dietary treatments). The treatments were: control diet (CTL); the basal diet without supplementations and propolis diet (RPE); the basal diet supplemented with 3 g RPE/ ewe/ day. The GC/MS analysis of RPE showed 20 different components all belonging to the flavonoids class were detected. Propolis supplementation increased (P = 0.02) organic matter and crud protein digestibility compared to the control. Higher intake of nitrogen (P = 0.03) and body N retention (P = 0.01) were observed with RPE supplementation compared to CTL, also, the retained N expressed as g/g N intake tended to increase (P = 0.063). The administration of RPE increased (P < 0.05) urinary allantoin derivative excretion and also total purine derivatives (PD) tended to increase (P = 0.06) for RPE compared to CTL. Enhanced individual, total short chain fatty acids and acetate/propionate ratio were exhibited (P < 0.05) by RPE supplementation compared to CTL. Additionally, RPE decreased (P < 0.05) CH4 emission compared to CTL. All hematological parameters and biochemical parameters including total protein, globulin and glucose were enhanced (P < 0.05) by RPE supplementation compared to CTL. Propolis supplementation decreased (P < 0.05) the tested hormones cortisol, triiodothyronine and thyroxine compared to CTL. This study illustrated that RPE represent a promising diet natural supplement for supporting body activates during the transition from late pregnancy to lactation without adverse impact on either animal productivity or environment. © 2021	Article	Scopus

Frequent droughts pose a challenge to water supply in terms of both quantity and quality. In order to cope with this, there has to be a documentation on the concentration of chemicals in water during such events. The southeast region of Brazil experienced a major drought event in 2014 leading to number of social, economic, and environmental impacts. The objective of the present paper is to understand the effect of an extreme drought on dissolved organic and inorganic carbon concentrations of the Piracicabal river, which is under high human pressure. Concentrations of both dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC) were monitored daily, for 30 days, during a dry month in 2014. DOC values found here were at least twice those observed in the river in non-extreme conditions. Rain events within this drought led to significant differences in discharge, DOC, and DIC. We built a dilution-concentration model which described an exponential relationship between discharge and both carbon forms. This indicated that drastic changes in concentrations of DOC and DIC are expected during such events. Our results may also apply to a number of regions in the world especially those of the developing countries where rivers are highly subjected to sewage impact. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.

Therefore, Micro-Tom tomato plants were grown under different levels of Ni (0.0 and 1.0 mg dm-3) and Ca2+ (0.35 and 0.70 g dm-3), both alone and in combination. Increased yields and urease activity, as well as inhibition of the incidence of BER, were observed for tomato fruits grown with Ni, even under low Ca availability (0.35 g dm-3). In addition, a microprobe X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy characterization of the distal part of the fruits revealed a sharp decrease in Ca content in the fruits that present BER symptoms.  © 	Article	Scopus

In this study, we applied microarray GeoChip v.5.0M technology to obtain a better insight into the prokaryotic communities and identify and quantify the N functional gene families associated with the N processes in sugarcane soils without N fertilizer (N0), with urea at 60 kg ha−1 (N60), and with vinasse combined with urea (NV). Soil samples were collected at 7 (T7) and 150 (T150) days after N application, corresponding to maximum and minimum nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, respectively, for molecular and physicochemical analysis. Additionally, the metagenomes of these DNA samples, previously deposited in the MG-RAST server, were accessed to investigate the functions and taxonomic groups associated with selected gene families. The results revealed that 87% of the select gene families were significantly responsive to the fertilizer combined treatment (NV) in the 7 days after the application. The most responsive genes and processes were nitrification [with the amoA gene from ammonia-oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) and Archaea (AOA) and hao from Bacteria], ammonification (with gdh and ureC genes from Bacteria and Archaea), and denitrification (with p450nor from Eukarya). The AOA, Nitrosopumilus, and AOB, Nitrosomonas, were the groups with the greatest functions associated with nitrification, as well as a pathogenic Mycobacterium, with denitrification. The results also revealed that under N fertilizers and decreased O2 in soil, the increases in K and P nutrients can promote the growth of the halophile Archaea Natronomonas and the Bacteria Anaeromyxobacter, which can reduce N2O. In conclusion, this typical agricultural fertilization management may favor functional genes and archaeal and bacterial groups associated with N processes that have the potential to reduce environmental damage in tropical sugarcane soils.

Therefore, 39 ewes were evaluated during 10 months under two treatments: Cottonseed and soybeans. The quantification of ovarian follicular dynamics was analyzed by ultrasound and the determination of progesterone and estradiol levels was interpreted by radioimmunoassay. After weaning, ovaries of lambs (n = 10) were collected by ovariectomy and fixed for the assessment of follicular parameters as normality, classification, diameter, ultrastructure, stereology, and as well as immunoexpression of the α-estradiol receptor α (ER-α). The results showed that the cottonseed consumption altered neither the ovarian nor the hormonal follicular dynamics of Santa Inês ewes after calving and did not affect the normality, classification, diameter, stereology and follicular ultrastructure of offspring. Nevertheless, the offspring of ewes fed with cottonseed showed high ER-α immunoexpression in the ovarian structures. It is concluded that cottonseed did not affect the maternal-descendant follicular dynamics. However, lambs' ovaries had highest α-ER immunoexpression in oocytes, granulosa and theca cells and corpus luteum. This fact warns of a possible change in the future steroidogenic response of these lambs that had progenitors consuming cottonseed in their reproductive period. © 2020	Article	Scopus

The proposed system enables to segregate of the complex matrix, species of interest from other interferences with a minimum requirement of reagents and energy. For this purpose, a new cleanup chamber design was implemented with cationic and anionic resins employed under membrane form and the tangential flow of the solution avoided the drawbacks commonly attributed to the packed and fluidized bed columns, such as the formation of preferred paths, increasing hydrodynamic pressure and clogging. The element concentration determination was colorimetrically performed with an automatic flow analysis system. The strategy was validated with the concentration determination of calcium and phosphorus in raw sugarcane juice. Quantification limit of 0.48 to calcium and 1.13 mg L−1 to phosphorus, linear range between 1 and 50 mg L−1, with RSD of 0.50 and 1.50% (n = 11) respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Growing evidence suggests the role of hormones and cell wall-related enzymes in response to acidic pH that could possibly avoid cell mortality. Here, we have investigated the role of ethylene and class III peroxidases (CIII Prxs) activity on sensitivity to further low pH treatment. Seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana were pretreated with ethylene, at various concentrations for various times, and then exposed to low pH. In contrast to non-treated roots, roots pretreated with ethylene for 3 h became tolerant to subsequent low pH, with negligible cell mortality in meristematic (MZ), transition (TZ), and early elongation (EZ) zones. This effect of ethylene was time dependent since it was achieved only when seedlings were pre-incubated with ethylene for at least 3 h. This tolerance induced by ethylene was not observed in the gain-of-function mutation etr1-1 (insensitive to ethylene 1–1). Besides, it was prevented by salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) which is an inhibitor of CIII Prxs activity. In late EZ, the decrease in cell expansion due to low pH was dependent on both ethylene signaling and a SHAM-sensitive process. The responses mediated by ethylene signaling might involve CIII Prxs-dependent cell wall modifications, leading to tolerance to low pH and arrest in cell expansion during stress. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Advanced technologies based on X-ray imaging provide markedly easier ways to control insect infestation of stored products, regardless of whether the quality features are visible on the surface of the grains. Here, we applied contrast enhancement algorithms based on peripheral equalization and calcification emphasis on X-ray images to improve the detection of Sitophilus zeamais in maize grains. In addition, we proposed an approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identity non-infested and infested classes using three different architectures; (i) Inception-ResNet-v2, (ii) Xception and (iii) MobileNetV2. In general, the prediction models developed based on the MobileNetV2 and Xception architectures achieved higher accuracy (≥0.88) in identifying non-infested grains and grains infested by maize weevil, with a correct classification from 0.78 to 1.00 for validation and test sets. Hence, the proposed approach using enhanced radiographs has the potential to provide precise control of Sitophilus zeamais for safe human consumption of maize grains. The proposed method can automatically recognize food contaminated with hidden storage pests without manual features, which makes it more reliable for grain inspection. © 2021 by the authors.

Carbon stable isotopes in soil samples provide information on the past vegetation type due to differences in mass fractionation during photosynthesis. Radiocarbon measurements on soil organic matter may also have different behaviors, given the complexity of soils as mixtures of multiple sources. With the aim of investigating how different soils, under different vegetation coverages, may affect paleoenvironmental reconstructions, we have analyzed four soil profiles collected at the Itatiaia National Park, between Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais states in Brazil, in the context of the Atlantic Forest biome, at altitudes between 1898m and 2457m. Different chemical fractions of the bulk soil were separately 14C dated for each sample depth. For the total soil and the non-hydrolyzable carbon, discrepancies in pMC values were mostly within 5% from the humin fraction values. Two Histosol profiles collected under forest vegetation on a hillside presented very different morphologies and chronologies, possibly related to colluvium effect, indicated by the deposition of originally older material. The results for a Histosol profile under grassland indicates that C3 plants were the dominant vegetation over most of the last 8000 years at the most distant location while a Cambisol profile under transitional vegetation shows variations, with C3 plants at ca. 2 kyr BP, switching to C4 before ca. 700 yr BP, suggesting anthropic influence. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Field experiments were carried out in 2016/17 at the first growing season; and the other in the second growing season, in Palotina, state of Paraná (PR), Brazil. The design was completely randomized block with 4 replications, which were set up with variations of rates of herbicides: glyphosate (0; 2,160; 4,320; 6,480 and 8,640 g ae ha-1) (experiment 1) and glufosinate (0; 1,500; 3,000; 4,500 and 6,000 g ai ha-1) (experiment 2). The application was performed at the V4 stage. Plants were evaluated for injuries, final plant height, stem diameter, 100-grain mass, yield and content of P, K, S, Fe, Cu and Zn. The results show that there was no reduction in yield and 100-grain mass, as well as changes in nutrient contents, even with the use of high rates of glyphosate and glufosinate. This is explained by the rapid recovery of maize hybrids under favorable developmental conditions. Despite causing injuries and decreased height, application of glyphosate (up to 8,640 g ae ha-1) or glufosinate (up to 6,000 ai ha-1) did neither reduce yield and 100-grain mass nor the nutrient contents of grains. This shows the high selectivity of these herbicides. Nonetheless, crop injury and reduction in height were observed in maize plants for herbicide application. This indicates the risks of using herbicides above the rates recommended in the package insert, despite the absence of deleterious effects on yield. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.	Article	Scopus

The high diversity of bamboos, distributed throughout the world and of high economic relevance, has deserved several studies on molecular characterization. This chapter describes how distinct categories of molecular markers, such as isozymes, RAPD, AFLP, microsatellites, and SNP, have enabled the analysis of population genetic processes, assessments of the genetic diversity, and structure of natural populations and selected cultivars of bamboo species. One important application is their power of phylogenetic inference, enabling the distinction of the diverse set of bamboo species. With the genomic technologies, gene families have been characterized, mainly for Phyllostachys edulis, which has its genome sequenced and deposited to databases, enabling the detection of markers related with environmental constraints. As vegetative propagation is a common mechanism in bamboos and their cultivation relies on this strategy, molecular markers have been important for attesting genetic fidelity to their original source of propagules. Altogether, we provide a panorama of several applications of molecular markers to bamboo conservation and breeding. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.

Biochars produced from different feedstock were used as soil amendments and compared with raw feedstock. Sorption–desorption experiments of indaziflam and its three metabolites were performed using the batch equilibration method and analyzed for 14C activity by liquid scintillation counting (radiometric technique). In all soils, the use of organic amendments promoted greater sorption and less desorption of indaziflam and ITI. The addition of biochar to soils promoted greater sorption of the four tested chemical products compared with the corresponding raw materials. Among the biochars, grape wood chips showed greater potential in sorb indaziflam and ITI. In general, none of the biochars affected the sorption and desorption of FDAT and ICA. Characterization of biochar to be used as a soil amendment (immobilizer) is highly recommended prior to field addition to optimize the sorption process and to prevent increased soil and water contamination of indaziflam and its metabolites following biochar addition. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This study evaluated the effect of using injection and surface application of PS, compared to NPK and control treatments, on the soil aggregate, C and N contents, and isotopes 13C and 15N. The NTS consisted of rotations of summer (maize) and winter (black oat and wheat) grasses from 2011 to 2015. The treatments were PS injected into the soil (PSI), PS applied on the soil surface (PSS), chemical fertilization (NPK), and control (CTRL). The following soil properties were evaluated in the 0–5, 5–10, and 10–20 cm layers: aggregate stability (geometric mean diameter–GMD; aggregate mass distribution); total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in macroaggregates (8.0–0.25 mm), microaggregates (<0.25 mm), and bulk soil (<2.0 mm); and isotopes 13C and 15N in macro and microaggregates. The application of PSI improved the soil physical attributes, presenting higher GMD (0–5 cm) than the PSS, NPK, and CTRL treatments. In the 5–10 cm layer, the PSI treatments were more efficient in increasing the GMD and macroaggregate mass than the NPK. PSI also was more efficient in increasing TOC and TN when compared to PSS, and generated a higher GMD, which are protectors of these elements in the soil. The natural abundance of 15N denoted the lower soil organic matter decomposition in the PSI treatment when compared to the PSS. The natural abundance of 13C showed less-negative values in macroaggregates than in microaggregates, denoting that the soil management practices and crops used (grasses) affected positively the abundance of 13C. After seven applications of PS in maize-oat-wheat rotation in NTS, the application of PSI was more efficient in improving the soil physical and chemical attributes than the application of PSS. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Our objective was to determine the amounts and forms of P according to companion crops (Brachiaria ruziziensis–a grass species–or Cajanus cajan–a leguminous species) and tillage systems (conventional or no-tillage). Materials and methods: Soil P pools were determined (Presin, POlsen, PNaOH-EDTA, and Ptotal) and P species were characterized by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Results and discussion: The concentrations of available and labile inorganic P (Presin, PiOlsen, and PiNaOH-EDTA) were greater in soil samples where companion crops (Brachiaria ruziziensis or Cajanus cajan) and maize were planted on the same row, with a more significant effect with the legume species. According to the 31P NMR, it is mostly the proportion and amount of POrthophosphate that was increased, with a slight increase of the content of PMonoester. Overall, there was a decrease of the proportion of organic P (PoNMR/PNMR) from 32 to 16% when the legume companion crop was associated with maize. Conclusions: The tillage systems did not lead to any change in the amounts and forms of P. Companion crops are thought to increase available P through mineralization of Po from plant residues and soil organic matter, leading to an increase of fluxes between active P pools. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

In this study, we investigated how drought and warming impact C:N:P stoichiometric ratios of different plant organs (leaves, inflorescences, and stems), and biomass allocation and production of a field-grown pasture of Stylosanthes capitata, a tropical forage legume. We evaluated the effects of elevated temperature (+2 °C above ambient temperature) under two conditions of soil water availability, irrigated, and non-irrigated. In general, we observed that different functional plant organs showed distinct responses to drought and warming demonstrating how important is to evaluate different functional plant organs to unravel crop nutrient dynamics. In addition, interactive effects between warming and drought were observed in many situations, highlighting the importance of multifactorial studies. Our data showed that warming produced plants with more inflorescences, decreasing leaf:inflorescence ratio. However, only warming under well-watered conditions improved biomass production (in 38%). Warmed and irrigated plants showed higher stoichiometric homeostasis compared to other treatments. In an opposite direction, drought decreased P concentration and increased N:P ratios in different organs, reducing the stoichiometric homeostasis under both conditions of temperature. We have concluded that warm and well-watered conditions without restrictions in soil nutrient availability can enhance plant production, presumably due to a higher level of stoichiometric homeostasis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

This study aimed to evaluate the residues from glyphosate formulations labeled with 14C-glyphosate applied to leaves of glyphosate-resistant soybean (GRS) in two life cycles by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Different plant tissues were analyzed after the end of the plants’ life cycles. The experimental design was four repetitions of three treatments: Roundup® Original, Roundup Ready®, and unformulated glyphosate (control). The application of the dosing solution was 120 µL on the first four trifoliate leaves (10 µL per leaflet) of each plant, deposited manually with a 1-µL dispenser. All treatment solutions were calculated at a 1.2 kg a.e ha−1 of glyphosate. Glyphosate formulations of Roundup® Original and Roundup Ready® increased 14C-glyphosate distribution in GRS compared to the unformulated herbicide, regardless of the experiment (first or second cycle). Overall, the percentages of total radioactivity applied (18.33 kBq) found in grains were less than 5%. Grains, stems, and leaves showed the highest levels of herbicide residues compared to other parts of the plant. Despite the Roundup Ready® formulation having increased residues, the highest value found in grains, 1.95 mg kg−1, was less than 10 mg kg−1, the maximum residue limit (MRL) in Brazil. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The microdilution technique was performed in order to determine the antibacterial activity of the crude extract alone as well as in combination with the bacteriocin, nisin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the crude extract and nisin alone against A. acidoterrestris vegetative forms were 250 μg/mL and 31.5 μg/mL, respectively, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were 1000 μg/mL and 62.5 μg/mL,respectively. For A. acidoterrestris spores, treatment with the crude extract at a concentration of 500 μg/mL caused a 47% reduction in growth, while nisin at 62.5 μg/mL could reduce 100% of the growth. The in vitro evaluation of the crude extract combined with nisin against A. acidoterrestris by the Checkerboard method showed a synergistic interaction between the two compounds. In addition, greater selectivity towards bacterial cells over host cells, a human hepatocyte cell line, was achieved when the crude extract was combined with nisin, Using scanning electron microscopy, interferences in the cell membrane of A. acidoterrestris could be observed after treatment with the crude extract. The results presented in this study indicate that the crude extract of the endophyte F. flavus has biotechnological potential in the food industry, especially for the treatment of orange juices through the control of A. acidoterrestris. © 2020	Article	Scopus

Nowadays, we have a vast array of technologies that allow us to assess the (meta-)transcriptome regarding its composition (which transcripts are produced) and the abundance of its components (what are the expression levels of each transcript), and we can do this across several samples, conditions, and time-points, at costs that are decreasing year after year, allowing experimental designs with ever-increasing complexity. Here we will present the current state of the art regarding the technologies that can be applied to the study of plant transcriptomes and their applications, including differential gene expression and coexpression analyses, identification of sequence polymorphisms, the application of machine learning for the identification of alternative splicing and ncRNAs, and the ranking of candidate genes for downstream studies. We continue with a collection of examples of these approaches in a diverse array of plant species to generate gene/transcript catalogs/atlases, population mapping, identification of genes related to stress phenotypes, and phylogenomics. We finalize the chapter with some of our ideas about the future of this dynamic field in plant physiology. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	Book chapter	Scopus

Sodium (Na) can substitute some physiological functions of potassium (K), directly influencing plants’ water status. However, the extent to which K can be replaced by Na in drought conditions remains poorly understood. A greenhouse experiment was conducted with three Eucalyptus genotypes under two water conditions (well-watered and water-stressed) and five combination rates of K and Na, representing substitutions of 0/100, 25/75, 50/50, 75/25, and 100/0 (percentage of Na/percentage of K), to investigate growth and photosynthesis-related parameters. This study focused on the positive effects of Na supply since, depending on the levels applied, the Na supply may induce plants to salinity stress (>100 mM of NaCl). Plants supplied with low to intermediate K replacement by Na reduced the critical level of K without showing symptoms of K deficiency and provided higher total dry matter (TDM) than those Eucalyptus seedlings supplied only with K in both water conditions. Those plants supplied with low to intermediate K replacement by Na had improved CO2 assimilation (A), stomatal density (Std), K use efficiency (UEK), and water use efficiency (WUE), in addition to reduced leaf water potential (Ψw) and maintenance of leaf turgidity, with the stomata partially closed, indicated by the higher values of leaf carbon isotope composition (δ13C‰). Meanwhile, combination rates higher than 50% of K replacement by Na led to K-deficient plants, characterized by the lower values of TDM, δ13C‰, WUE, and leaf K concentration and higher leaf Na concentration. There was positive evidence of partial replacement of K by Na in Eucalyptus seedlings; meanwhile, the ideal percentage of substitution increased according to the drought tolerance of the species (Eucalyptus saligna < Eucalyptus urophylla < Eucalyptus camaldulensis). © Copyright © 2021 Mateus, Leite, Santos, Ferraz, Goncalves and Lavres.

In these crop systems, nitrogen (N) is the most essential nutrient. Nitrogen needs vary according to environmental conditions and crop rotation and are higher when crop succession is performed with grasses only. Intercropping maize with legumes is an interesting alternative to improve agricultural management and N cycling. To better understand N dynamics in ICLSs, in this study, two maize (Zea mays L.) silage production systems were developed: intercropping with palisadegrass (Urochloa brizantha ‘Marandu’, syn. Brachiaria brizantha) only or palisadegrass and pigeon pea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] (summer–autumn). In both intercropping systems, black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) was oversown and grazed by lambs (winter–spring). We assessed biomass production, N uptake, and fertilizer-N recovery due to the addition of 15N-labeled fertilizer in maize intercropped with palisadegrass and pigeon pea and the residual effect on black oat grazed by lambs during two growing seasons in a Typic Haplorthox in southeastern Brazil. The triple intercropped crops produced higher amounts of silage and pasture biomass and efficiently increased the use of N fertilizer by maize, thereby promoting greater 15N recovery. Palisadegrass and pigeon pea are a good option for cultivation in tropical regions, as this combination did not alter the measured levels of N in the intercropping systems but improved N dynamics, efficiency, balance, and N fertilizer distribution in the soil-plant system. This study provides a better understanding of N dynamics in the soil-plant system to support more efficient N fertilization in ICLS under NT. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Furthermore, micro-X-ray absorption near edge structure (μ-XANES) spectroscopy has a potential application in environmental studies by adding speciation information under in-situ conditions. Both, μ-XRF and μ-XANES, techniques were used to assess the inter-ring and intra-ring chemical content variations of Avicennia schaueria mangrove tree from Southeastern Brazil. Ca, Cl, K, P, and S were the major chemical elements distributed in almost all tree-rings. Ca was the most abundant element and showed a decreasing trend from heartwood to sapwood tree-rings. Calcium also showed a characteristic distribution pattern along the growth layer, acting as a chemical marker of growth layers. Ca chemical species were distinct in sapwood (calcium oxalate and carbonate-rich) and heartwood tree-rings (calcium sulfate-rich), showing different physiological Ca roles on tree performance. The synchrotron radiation-based techniques at micrometer scale provided information on the distribution and speciation of chemical elements within and between tree-rings. We also present a µ-XANES procedure for data collection and processing for dendrochemical studies. Altogether, we opened opportunities for further studies aiming to understand which environmental or physiological variables are responsible for tree-ring chemical speciation and distribution changes in tree species. © 2021 The Authors	Article	Scopus

Five of these species are palynologically characterised for the first time. Hippomaneae pollen is shed in monads, being small to large, isopolar, oblate-spheroidal to prolate, with an amb ranging from circular, three-lobed to distinctly three-lobed, tricolporate, very long colpi (except for Hura crepitans in which is long), margo psilate (rugulate only in Colliguaja brasiliensis), narrow to wide, and endoapertures circular, lalongate to very lalongate, with costae. Sexine thicker than the nexine. Sexine is psilate-perforate except for Algernonia brasiliensis, C. brasiliensis, Gymnanthes multiramea, G. schottiana, Microstachys corniculata, Pleradenophora membranifolia, and Sebastiania brasiliensis where it is microreticulate. Only in M. corniculata the sexine is separated from the nexine at the mesocolpus, forming a cavea. Although the Hippomaneae are considered stenopalynous in the literature, our results showed variation between species and genera groups, reinforcing the relevance of pollen morphology in the systematics of this tribe. © 2021 Collegium Palynologicum Scandinavicum.

Despite having a chemical structure like synthetic organophosphates, there is still no analytical standard available for environmental and freshwater monitoring. Therefore, this study investigated the stability of GNT under different storage conditions, pH, and temperature. The toxin is produced by the cyanobacterium Sphaerospermopsis torques-reginae and monitored by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and LC-MS/MS for the identification and verification of its stability. The main degradation product formed is the hydroxy-amino-guanidinic derivative of the toxin. The results also indicate that GNT is stable in acidic medium (pH = 3.0), but can gradually degrade at room temperature (> 23 ºC) over a period of 96 h. Lyophilized biomass of S. torques-reginae containing GNT remained stable when stored in a refrigerator below 4 ºC. In addition, the extraction yield is higher when prepared from fresh S. torques-reginae cells than from lyophilized material. Thus, the results shown here contribute with valuable information for studies that aim at the isolation, identification, and monitoring of GNT in samples of raw water and cyanobacterial blooms. © 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

Sustainable intensification of animal production systems could be achieved through silvopastoral systems (SPS). Despite the fact that Brazil has always been at the forefront of agricultural development in Latin America, silvopastoral system areas seem to expand more modestly. Thus, the objective of this review is to describe the history of alternative forage crops in Brazil and to understand the factors that limit the adoption of SPS. © 2021 Fundacion CIPAV.

Feedstocks with increased levels of one hydroxycinnamate in preference to the other are therefore highly desirable. We identified and conducted expression analysis for nine BAHD acyltransferase ScAts genes from sugarcane. The high conservation of AT10 proteins, together with their similar gene expression patterns, supported a similar role in distinct grasses. Overexpression of ScAT10 in maize resulted in up to 75% increase in total pCA content. Mild hydrolysis and derivatization followed by reductive cleavage (DFRC) analysis showed that pCA increase was restricted to the hemicellulosic portion of the cell wall. Furthermore, total FA content was reduced up to 88%, resulting in a 10-fold increase in the pCA/FA ratio. Thus, we functionally characterized a sugarcane gene involved in pCA content on hemicelluloses and generated a C4 plant that is promising for valorizing pCA production in biorefineries. © Copyright © 2021 Fanelli, Rancour, Sullivan, Karlen, Ralph, Riaño-Pachón, Vicentini, Silva, Ferraz, Hatfield and Romanel.

To maintain sterile male fly quality without jeopardizing sterility, a strategy of applying the radiation dose under an oxygen-reduced atmosphere is commonly used. Therefore, this study tested a range of gamma radiation doses under hypoxia on pupae from a bisexual strain and a novel genetic sexing strain (GSS) of A. fraterculus. Four types of crosses between irradiated flies under hypoxia and nonirradiated flies of the bisexual strain were set to assess sterility for each strain and radiation dose. For males from both strains, the effect of radiation dose on the percentage of egg hatch, egg-to-pupa recovery, and recovery of adults were determined. A dose of 74 Gy reduced egg hatch by 99% regardless of the male strain and was considered the sterilizing dose. The fertility of irradiated females and development of their offspring were severely affected, even at low doses under hypoxia, and no eggs were laid with doses above 50 Gy. A common strategy used to maintain sterile fly quality without sacrificing sterility is to irradiate the insects under an oxygen-reduced atmosphere. So far, sterilizing doses for the South American fruit fly Anastrepha fraterculus have only been determined under normoxia. Our study reports for the first time the dose-sterility response under hypoxia for two different A. fraterculus strains. The pupae were derived from a bisexual strain (a Brazilian-1 population) and a recently developed genetic sexing strain (GSS-89). Two hours prior to irradiation, pupae were transferred to sealed glass bottles and irradiated when oxygen concentration was below 3%. Four types of crosses with nonirradiated flies of the bisexual strain were set to assess sterility for each radiation dose. For males from both strains, Weibull dose-response curves between radiation doses and the proportion of egg hatch, egg-to-pupa recovery, and recovery of adults were determined. The GSS males revealed high sterility/mortality levels compared to males from the bisexual strain at doses < 40 Gy, but a dose of 74 Gy reduced egg hatch by 99% regardless of the male strain and was considered the sterilizing dose. The fertility of irradiated females was severely affected even at low doses under hypoxia. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	Article	Scopus

Analytical methods recommended for the quantification of uric acid, such as high-performance liquid chromatography, are typically time-consuming and require high-cost equipment. In this study, a simple and cost-effective approach was developed for the determination of uric acid in saliva, by combining a spot test with smartphone-based digital image colorimetry. It was based on the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) by uric acid, followed by complexation with 2,2′-biquinoline-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (BCA), resulting in a violet product. Derivatization reactions and photometric measurements were both carried out in Eppendorf® tubes to facilitate the manipulation of biological samples. A smartphone camera and a free application (PhotoMetrix® 1.8) were used to capture the image and convert it to RGB values. Photometric measurements were based on reflected radiation in the G channel, corresponding to the complementary color of the product, yielding a linear response between 25 and 150 µmol L−1. The coefficient of variation (n = 10) and the limit of detection were 1.4% and 8 µmol L−1, respectively. Both reagent consumption (8.3 µg Cu(II), 3.8 mg ammonium acetate, and 156 µg BCA per determination) and waste volume (900 µL per determination) were minimized. The results agreed with those obtained by HPLC, demonstrating that the approach is a reliable alternative for large scale clinical analysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

We evaluated the short-term effects of Ni application on field-grown soybean yield, growth, and soil chemical attributes using three sources of SAA, two enriched with Ni (Ni-rich mining by-product and Ni-salt) and a commercial SAA. The tested Ni-enriched sources were effective in providing Ni to the soil at safe levels, neutralizing acidity and increasing base saturation. A one-time Ni application resulted in optimal Ni levels in the first cropping season, enhancing grain yield by up to 658 kg ha−1 and improving nitrogen metabolism in soybean. A low residual effect of Ni was observed in the second year, with soil available Ni and plant Ni concentrations decreasing to sub-optimal levels and yield gains not being observed. In conclusion, the application of Ni-enriched SAA is a sustainable technology for agriculture, optimizing soil management practices. The SAA derived from by-products has benefits to the mining sector, meeting the ‘Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns’ (SDG 12). Our findings suggest that this micronutrient may require a year-to-year adjustment via Ni-fertilization and the total Ni concentration in the soil should be monitored over the cropping seasons. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

We hypothesized that less water-soluble sources of manganese (Mn; MnCO3) could serve as a slow-release source compared to a water-soluble source (MnSO4.H2O). Our goal here was to evaluate Mn-sources (MnSO4.H2O and MnCO3) and rates (150; 250; 350; and 450 g ha−1) sprayed in the 3rd and 4th trifoliate leaflets of soybean growing in clayey and sandy soil under controled conditions. In phenological stages V7 (vegetative period) and R1 (reproductive period), dry matter, height, the diameter of the stem, and Mn-content in the shoot, stem, and in the trifoliate leaflets were determined. Results showed that the application of Mn resulted in an augmented Mn-content in the 3rd and 4th trifoliate leaflets (sandy) and the 3rd and 5th trifoliate (clayey). The MnSO4.H2O promoted Mn-retranslocation from the 3rd/4th trifoliate to the stem and the 5th/6th trifoliate. However, MnCO3 was accumulated in the 3rd/4th trifoliate. The Mn-rates presented a linear response in sandy soil and quadratic response in clayey soil. Clayey soil was characterized by the higher Mn-contents in the stem, while sandy soil presented the higher Mn-contents in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th trifoliate. Our results suggest that MnSO4.H2O is more effective in increasing Mn-content in soybean leaves during plant development due to the Mn-retranslocation to sink organs (5th/6th trifoliate leaflets and shoot). © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

To analyse the degradation products, a reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) indicative stability method was successfully developed. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a Poroshell HPH-C18 150 x 4.6 mm, 4 μm, column at 25°C, with a mobile phase constituted by 0.1% phosphoric acid and acetonitrile in gradient at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1, using ultraviolet detection at 220 nm and injection volume of 20 μL. In total, eight unknown impurities were found. The peaks RRt 0.49, RRt 0.75, and RRt 0.95 were above 0.17%, corresponding to the identification threshold. Those were identified and characterized by LC-MS-QTOF, with the same chromatographic conditions, except for the exchange of 0.1% phosphoric acid for 0.1% formic acid. The impurities originated from the interaction of ibuprofen with excipients: Esterification with PEG, with sorbitol/sorbitan, and with glycerol by-products, which has not yet been reported in the literature. The developed method can be used in several pharmaceutical areas as quality control of impurities, studies of forced degradation, and for the development of future formulations. © 2021 Govi-Verlag Pharmazeutischer Verlag GmbH.

The replacement of saltmarshes by mangroves is expected due to global warming, reflecting the long-term natural trends in the Holocene and anthropogenic impacts since the 20th century. We documented the Holocene history of wetlands dynamics in the boreal limits of the American mangroves, located at Bay Champagne, Louisiana (USA), by integrating sedimentological, palynological, geochemical (δ13C and C\N), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) data, and radiocarbon chronology from two sediment cores. The results indicated a freshwater lake environment with herbs and wetland ferns, as well as C3 terrestrial plants, between ~8100 and ~6500 cal yr BP. This environment shifted into a lagoon and saltmarshes having sedimentary organic matter sourced from marine algae between ~6500 and ~1500 cal yr BP. In the final stage, washover sediments were deposited in the lagoon during the last ~1500 cal yr BP. Despite the increased marine influence over the last ~6500 cal yr BP, mangrove pollen were not recorded between ~8100 and ~1500 cal yr BP, suggesting that mangroves were absent in the study area during that time interval. Historical evidence and a comparative analysis of our multi-proxy data with other mangrove studies from the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and eastern South America revealed a gradual mangrove expansion from tropical to subtropical coasts of South and North America during the mid-late Holocene. The mangrove colonies at their current boreal (29° 09′ N) and austral (28° 29′ S) limits were established in the early and mid-20th century, respectively. This mangrove dynamics on a continental scale suggests that the poleward mangrove migration was likely caused by the warming climate during the Holocene. More importantly, the industrial-era warming has likely accelerated the mangrove expansion, but it was not the primary force that drove the mangrove migration into temperate zones. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The overall higher efficiency on nutrient use translated into faster growth rates in C4 grass plants led to the investigation of differential transcriptional and metabolic responses to short-term chemical TOR complex (TORC) suppression in the model Setaria viridis. In addition to previously described responses to TORC inhibition (i.e., general growth arrest, translational repression, and primary metabolism reprogramming) in Arabidopsis thaliana (C3), the magnitude of changes was smaller in S. viridis, particularly regarding nutrient use efficiency and C allocation and partitioning that promote biosynthetic growth. Besides photosynthetic differences, S. viridis and A. thaliana present several specificities that classify them into distinct lineages, which also contribute to the observed alterations mediated by TOR. Indeed, cell wall metabolism seems to be distinctly regulated according to each cell wall type, as synthesis of non-pectic polysaccharides were affected in S. viridis, whilst assembly and structure in A. thaliana. Our results indicate that the metabolic network needed to achieve faster growth seems to be less stringently controlled by TORC in S. viridis. © Copyright © 2021 da Silva, Martins, Calderan-Rodrigues, Artins, Monte Bello, Gupta, Sobreira, Riaño-Pachón, Mafra and Caldana.

However, since this currently is a polyphy-letic genus, the diversity of Nostoc-like cyanobacteria is considerably underestimated at this moment. While reviewing the phylogenetic placement of previously isolated Nostoc-like cyanobacteria originating from Brazilian Amazon, Caatinga and Atlantic forest samples, we detected 17 strains isolated from soil, freshwater, rock and tree surfaces presenting patterns that diverged significantly from related strains when ecological, morphological, molecular and genomic traits were also considered. These observations led to the identification of the evaluated strains as representative of three novel nostocacean genera and species: Amazonocrinis nigriterrae gen. nov., sp. nov.; Atlanticothrix silvestris gen. nov., sp. nov.; and Dendronalium phyllosphericum gen. nov., sp. nov., which are herein described according to the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants. This finding highlights the great importance of tropical and equatorial South American ecosystems for harbouring an unknown microbial diversity in the face of the anthropogenic threats with which they increasingly struggle. © 2021 The Authors.

This crop leaves huge amounts of straw behind which have to be managed with innovative approaches. In this study, a field experiment was carried out over six successive years of sugarcane harvests to evaluate the effect of straw maintenance on the field on changes in soil phosphorus (P) fractions. Four straw maintenance rates were tested: (i) maintaining 15 Mg ha−1 (SM15); (ii) maintaining 10 Mg ha−1 (SM10); (iii) maintaining 5 Mg ha−1 (SM5), and (iv) maintaining 0 Mg ha−1 (SM0). Our results showed that low maintenance of straw (SM5) resulted in the highest amount of P extracted by anion exchange resin and inorganic P extracted by 0.5 mol L−1 NaHCO3 in 0−5 and 5−10 cm soil depths. While total removal of residues resulted in soil P deficiency after six crop cycles, keeping straw on the soil surface at the rate of 5 Mg ha−1 supports plant growth without the need for P fertilizer application. We detected inorganic P extracted by 0.1 mol L−1 NaOH as the sink of P derived from straw since it was the only P fraction which increased with increasing straw on the soil surface. Non-labile P fractions were not influenced by straw maintenance rates in all depths. This is a promising result since it shows that P derived from straw does not accumulate in non-labile P fractions which are not plant available. Inorganic P was not influenced by straw removal rates and total P was only changed in 0−5 cm soil layer, while organic P was affected in all depths. We observed that organic P is available to sugarcane plants under SM0, SM5, and SM10, while under SM15, organic P does not play a role in sugarcane nutrition. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Thereby, a dialysis tubing membrane was employed as a leaf cell-proxy for tracing the release of three commercial foliar fertilizer formulations and their correspondent primary compounds, MnCO3, Mg(OH)2, and Cu2 O at the field-recommended concentration, by simply measuring changes on conductivity and pH during 96 h. It enabled either modulating fertilizer diffusion kinetics, as well as comparing the commercial formulations to its primary compound ones. Hence, the proposed approach stands out as a fast and effective tool for addressing relevant information about the performance of foliar fertilizer formulation, one of the bottlenecks of programs developing new fertilizer formulations. © 2021, Agronomic Institute of Campinas.

Restoring lands is especially important in the Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot in Brazil threatened by deforestation. To successfully restore degraded lands, it is necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation. However, studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce. This lack of information hampers the Atlantic Forest restoration and, given the original complexity of its ecological dynamics, restoration success is even more challenging in this ecosystem. This study aimed to assess carbon stocks (above and belowground), carbon content (%), and carbon isotope at 5-year old sites implemented by different restoration methods in southeastern Brazil. The restoration methods tested were active restoration (AR), assisted restoration (AsR), and passive restoration in an abandoned pasture (AP), which were compared to a nearby pasture (P) and a remaining forest fragment (RF). The assessed pools were: tree, coarse roots, fine roots, herbaceous, litter, standing dead wood, fallen dead wood, and soil (0–1 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–20 cm layers). Total carbon stock was higher on RF (152.304 Mg C ha−1), followed by the P (84.378 Mg C ha−1), AR (66.414 Mg C ha−1), AsR (65.73 Mg C ha−1) and AP (65.581 Mg C ha−1). The restoration areas sites are still too young to show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of different restoration methods. However, carbon stock and carbon content (%) differed among the pools according to the method and, in all cases, the largest carbon pool was soil, which shows the importance of sampling every pool for carbon stock and carbon content (%) estimation. Isotope analysis showed that carbon inputs in the soil had different sources, C3 or C4 plants, depending on the method. We concluded that these young secondary areas are already sequestering carbon, which helps mitigate global warming, and that monitoring every pool is important for a complete assessment, not only to restore secondary forests and understand growth but also for other land-uses such as pastures. Besides, the results obtained can be generalized to other tropical forest ecosystems with similar conditions (local and landscape), constituting a relevant contribution to forest restoration and carbon-sequestration related sciences. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Its demand is increasing, requiring the development of new hybrid cultivars, with better agronomic and nutritional categories. The objective of the study was to carry out agronomic, physical-applied and sensory evaluations of five hybrids and an open pollination cultivar (OP) (BRS Moema) of C. chinense. The five hybrids obtained higher productivity, yield and biometry of fruits, being ideal for the processed and fresh market. The cultivar BRS Moema and two hybrids (F1 10 and F1 12), had better fruit properties (lipids and fibers), and the F1 12 hybrid stood out for containing the highest antioxidant activity and capsaicin content. From the sensory point of view, the hybrids had greater sums for the attributes of preference (size, color, pungency and sweet taste). Thus, it is concluded that the hybrids F1 12 and F1 23 have the potential to be new cultivars in terms of productivity and yield, combining good agronomic, nutritional and sensory characteristics for a C. chinense species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, it presents serious phytopathological problems, such as anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. The objective of this study was to verify if C. siamense, a mycovirus-carrying endophytic fungus, could protect guarana seedlings, by reducing or by eliminating characteristic disease symptoms. Other physiological changes in the plant caused by the presence of this endophyte were also evaluated. The cuttings of the Cereçaporanga cultivar were dipped in a biological control suspension and planted in a specific substrate. After four months in the greenhouse, the seedlings were sprayed with a suspension of phytopathogen conidia, and a portion of these seedlings received the fungicide indicated for the crop to be compared with the control seedlings. After 28 days, the number of lesions, morphophysiological and macro characteristics, and leaf micronutrients were evaluated.The seedlings treated with C. siamense showed a lower percentage of lesions and an increased aerial part and root system compared to the other treatments. There were no significant differences between treatments regarding the percentage of macronutrients and micronutrients © 2021 by the authors.

The procedure is based on analyte oxidation of iron(II) followed by formation of a red iron(III)-thiocyanate complex. The acid medium required for complex formation doubles as a protein precipitation solution, while digital images are taken directly in disposable microtubes under controlled illumination conditions without sample pretreatment. Determination of the adulterant takes about 2 min and generates as little as 350 μL of waste per determination. A linear response was attained from 2.5 to 25.0 mg L−1, with a limit of detection of 1.7 mg L−1 at a 95% confidence level. Repeatability and reproducibility, expressed as coefficients of variation, were 4.8% and 6.8%, respectively. Due to these characteristics, along with the portability and wide availability of smartphones, the proposed method is attractive for determination of hydrogen peroxide adulterant at different stages of production chain. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, information regarding the degradation of this herbicide in the soil is missing. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the behavior of quinclorac in five tropical soils of contrasting textures by quantifying the extracted residue with formation of metabolites, bound residue and mineralization to 14CO2. The herbicide was applied at the dose of 15.1 Bq per biometric vial. For mineralization, 10 mL of NaOH were used, with weekly analyses of radioactivity in the liquid scintillation spectrometer, up to 240 days after application (DAA). Extractions were performed using NaOH and acetone. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) plates were used for the separation of the extracted residue in quinclorac and its metabolites. After the extraction, the soils were burned in a biological oxidizer to quantify the bound residue. Half-life (DT50) ranged from 57.7 to 266.5 days and five metabolites were found. The mineralized 14CO2 ranged from 12.5 to 25.6%, extracted residue from 104.3% to 23.3% and the bound residue from 3.6 to 49.5%. Quinclorac showed high persistence in the soil, which could cause carryover in subsequent crops and reach non-target organisms, but this depends on the physicochemical characteristics of each soil. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Correlations of the internal chemical environment with NMR relaxometry signals is an important parameter for food quality control, however, differently from controlled processed food, internal fruits environment has not always a straight correlation with relaxometry signals. In this paper we demonstrate that Time Domain-NMR signals combined with chemometrics analysis are a powerful tool for studies and industrial control of the internal quality of Palmer mangoes, providing tools to evaluate the fruit ripeness and internal flesh breakdown, which are highly difficult to be detected in intact fruits by other analytical methods. Results shows that combining transverse relaxation time distribution with Principal Component Analysis it is possible to classify three groups: unripe mangoes, ripe mangoes, and ripe mangoes with physiological defects. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Thermochemical processing these manures may be an alternative to concentrate nutrients and reduce the final volume for agriculture application. We aimed here to evaluate the viability of extracting nutrients from chicken manure using a thermochemical process which reduces the volume of transported nutrients, targeting phosphorus (P) recovery as precipitated struvite, without add external source of P. The extraction of nutrients from poultry manure was performed in water, followed by a thermochemical treatment of the solid phase by incineration and acidulation of the resulting ash. Struvite was produced from the acidified ash extract after supplementation with Mg and regulating the pH (~8.5) by KOH addition. The recovery efficiency of P from the poultry manure and incorporation into struvite was 90%. The final product was a multi-nutrient fertilizer with high macronutrient levels (P, K, Mg and S) and low micronutrient content when compared to fresh manure, as well as lower levels of heavy metals, potentially harmful for the environment. The precipitated product obtained here is composed of struvite-NH4 and struvite-K, alongside appreciable quantities of potassium sulphate and hydroxyapatite carbonate. Overall, we conclude that poultry manure represents a viable source of P and N for struvite production resulting in a nutrient-rich, pathogen-free inorganic fertiliser suitable for widespread use in agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

However, the limit of beneficial and toxic physiological effects of Se is very narrow. In the present study, the antioxidant performance, nutritional composition, long-distance transport of Se, photosynthetic pigments, and growth of Coffea arabica genotypes in response to Se concentration in solution were evaluated. Five Coffea arabica genotypes (Obatã, IPR99, IAC125, IPR100 and Catucaí) were used, which were grown in the absence and presence of Se (0 and 1.0 mmol L−1) in nutrient solution. The application of 1 mmol L−1 Se promoted root browning in all genotypes. There were no visual symptoms of leaf toxicity, but there was a reduction in the concentration of phosphorus and sulfur in the shoots of plants exposed to high Se concentration. Except for genotype Obatã, the coffee seedlings presented strategies for regulating Se uptake by reducing long-distance transport of Se from roots to shoots. The concentrations of total chlorophyll, total pheophytin, and carotenoids were negatively affected in genotypes Obatã, IPR99, and IAC125 upon exposure to Se at 1 mmol L−1. H2O2 production was reduced in genotypes IPR99, IPR100, and IAC125 upon exposure to Se, resulting in lower activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). These results suggest that antioxidant metabolism was effective in regulating oxidative stress in plants treated with Se. The increase in sucrose, and decrease in SOD, CAT and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities, as well as Se compartmentalization in the roots, were the main biochemical and physiological modulatory effects of coffee seedlings under stress conditions due to excess of Se. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The methanotrophic interaction network, comprising methanotrophs and non-methanotrophs, is thought to modulate methane oxidation and give rise to emergent properties beneficial for the methanotrophs. Therefore, microbial interaction may become relevant for community functioning under stress. However, empirical validation of the role and stressor-induced response of the interaction network remains scarce. Here, we determined the response of a complex methane-driven interaction network to a stepwise increase in NH4Cl-induced stress (0.5-4.75 g L-1, in 0.25-0.5 g L-1increments) using enrichment of a naturally occurring complex community derived from a paddy soil in laboratory-scale incubations. Although ammonium and intermediates of ammonium oxidation are known to inhibit methane oxidation, methanotrophic activity was unexpectedly detected even in incubations with high ammonium levels, albeit rates were significantly reduced. Sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA and pmoA genes consistently revealed divergent communities in the reference and stressed incubations. The 16S rRNA-based co-occurrence network analysis revealed that NH4Cl-induced stress intensification resulted in a less complex and modular network, likely driven by less stable interaction. Interestingly, the non-methanotrophs formed the key nodes, and appear to be relevant members of the community. Overall, stressor intensification unravels the interaction network, with adverse consequences for community functioning. © 2020 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

The proposed method involves the precipitation of the proteins by the salting-out effect of copper sulfate and the proportional adsorption of Cu(II) on the precipitate. Subsequently, photometric measurements of the remaining amount of Cu(II) by smartphone-based digital colorimetry are conducted to determine the protein content. The proposed procedure is rapid (sample throughput of 32 assays/h), precise (coefficient of variation = 3.0%, n = 20), environmentally friendly, and allows the detection of as low as 1.0% v/v water in adulterated milk. The main species used to mask the protein content do not interfere, thus permitting the direct detection of adulteration. The procedure was successfully applied for the classification of milk samples as compliant and non-compliant as well as for the indirect determination of the protein content in milk. The quantitative results agreed with those obtained by the reference method (near infrared spectroscopy) at a 95% confidence level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

However, little is known about the effects on the stoichiometric relationships between C, N, and P when silicon is supplied via different modes in sorghum and sunflower plants under salt stress conditions. Therefore, the current study was performed to investigate the impact of differing modes of Si supply on shoot biomass production and C:N:P stoichiometry in sorghum and sunflower plants under salt stress. Two experiments were performed in a glass greenhouse using the strong Si-accumulator plant sorghum, as well as the intermediate type Si-accumulator sunflower, both of which were grown in pots filled with washed sand. Plant species were cultivated for 30 days in the absence or presence of salt stress (0 or 100 mM) and supplemented with one of four Si treatments: control plants (without Si), 28.6 mmol Si L−1 via foliar application, 2.0 mmol Si L−1 via nutrient solution, and combined application of foliar and nutrient solution, each group with five replications. The results revealed that supplied Si modified the C, N, and P concentrations, thereby enhancing the C:N:P stoichiometry and shoot dry matter of sorghum and sunflower plants under salt stress. Both application of Si via nutrient solution, as well as combined application via foliar and nutrient solution, increased the C:N ratio in both plant species under salt stress, but in sorghum plants decreased the C:P and N:P ratios and increased the shoot biomass production by 39%, while in sunflower plants increased the C:P and N:P ratios and increased the shoot biomass production by 24%. Our findings suggest that salt stress alleviation by Si impacts C:N:P stoichiometric relationships in a variable manner depending on the ability of the species to accumulate Si, as well as the route of Si administration. © 2020 The Author(s)	Article	Scopus

Optical imaging is a rapid, non-destructive, and accurate technology that can produce consistent measurements of product quality compared to conventional techniques. In this research, a novel approach for seed quality prediction is presented. In the proposed approach two advanced optical imaging techniques based on chlorophyll fluorescence and chemometric-based multispectral imaging were employed. The chemometrics encompassed principal component analysis (PCA) and quadratic discrimination analysis (QDA). Among plants that are relevant as both crops and scientific models, tomato, and carrot were selected for the experiment. We compared the optical imaging techniques to the traditional analytical methods used for quality characterization of commercial seedlots. Results showed that chlorophyll fluorescence-based technology is feasible to discriminate cultivars and to identify seedlots with lower physiological potential. The exploratory analysis of multispectral imaging data using a non-supervised approach (two-component PCA) allowed the characterization of differences between carrot cultivars, but not for tomato cultivars. A Random Forest (RF) classifier based on Gini importance was applied to multispectral data and it revealed the most meaningful bandwidths from 19 wavelengths for seed quality characterization. In order to validate the RF model, we selected the five most important wavelengths to be applied in a QDA-based model, and the model reached high accuracy to classify lots with high-and low-vigor seeds, with a correct classification from 86 to 95% in tomato and from 88 to 97% in carrot for validation set. Further analysis showed that low quality seeds resulted in seedlings with altered photosynthetic capacity and chlorophyll content. In conclusion, both chlorophyll fluorescence and chemometrics-based multispectral imaging can be applied as reliable proxies of the physiological potential in tomato and carrot seeds. From the practical point of view, such techniques/methodologies can be potentially used for screening low quality seeds in food and agricultural industries. © Copyright © 2020 Galletti, Carvalho, Hirai, Brancaglioni, Arthur and Barboza da Silva.

Chemical and isotopic analyses of 50 vermetid bioconstructions from distinct localities of south-southeastern Brazilian coast indicate possible changes in the coastal water temperature. These changes may have been caused by oscillations in the strength of Brazilian Coastal Current, which carries La Plata Plume northward, being therefore responsible for the penetration of cold and less saline water masses in the study area. This is a reasonable explanation for the scarcity of vermetid biolithites around 3.4–2.6 cal ka BP and 0.5–0 cal ka BP. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

An advantage of decentralized sanitation systems is the separation of the blackwater (BW) stream, contaminated with human pathogens, from the remaining household water. However, the composition and functions of the microbial community in BW are not known. In this study, we used shotgun metagenomics to assess the dynamics of microbial community structure and function throughout a new BW anaerobic digestion system installed at The Netherlands Institute of Ecology. Samples from the influent (BW), primary effluent (anaerobic digested BW), sludge and final effluent of the pilot upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor and microalgae pilot tubular photobioreactor (PBR) were analyzed. Our results showed a decrease in microbial richness and diversity followed by a decrease in functional complexity and co-occurrence along the different modules of the bioreactor. The microbial diversity and function decrease were reflected both changes in substrate composition and wash conditions. Our wastewater treatment system also decreased microbial functions related to pathogenesis. In summary, the new sanitation system studied here fosters microbial groups and functions that allow the system to efficiently and robustly recover carbon and nutrients while reducing pathogenic groups, ultimately generating a final effluent safe for discharge and reuse. © 2020 by the authors.

The Posses (PS) and Salto de Cima (SC) catchments (1200 ha and 1500 ha, respectively) are situated in the municipality of Extrema, Minas Gerais state. Their streams flow into the Jaguari River that supplies part of the water demand of the São Paulo metropolitan area. Samples were collected for chemical analysis and physical-chemical field measures every 2 weeks from January to December 2017. An important pollution point source was discovered in the PS stream related to bovine urine and feces, as well another unidentified source that can be related to a small food processing industry and/or a small fish farm. At the SC stream, on the other hand, there was clear evidence of domestic sewage input. This preliminary study confirmed a limited improvement of the stream water quality in response to recovery of the forest vegetation. Therefore, we recommend that in addition to enhanced monitoring to help distinguish biogeochemical sources and the benefits of land conservation practices, the ESP program should consider controlling point source pollution to accomplish its purpose. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

These microorganisms can produce bioactive compounds. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the leaf endophytic fungi microbiota from J. brandegeana using the culture-dependent method and multilocus sequence analysis. The endophyte's isolation was performed by the fragmentation method and the MLSA phylogeny was made using ITS, elongation factor 1-α, β-tubulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and, actin genes. For the screening selection, agar piece test was performed and, amongst the strains, JB06 isolate was chosen for metabolic extraction from the fermented culture and the evaluation of the antibacterial, antioxidant, antiproliferative activities and, phenolic compounds assay. Through the MLSA analysis, there were five genera of fungi identified, with Colletotrichum the higher isolated. For the antioxidant assay using the fungal extract obtained from Mycoleptodiscus indicus (JB06), the best results were obtained with the ABTS method. Antiproliferative effects by the crude extract of the endophyte against the tumor hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2/C3A) were found. In summary, our findings revealed highly diverse endophytic fungi associated with J. brandegeana, with the bioprospection of the endophyte M. indicus with biotechnological potential for the health field. © 2020 SAAB	Article	Scopus

Marandu) is considered a highly relevant cropping system to deliver both residue and forage. However, the benefits of inclusion of palisadegrass in maize systems and its influence on fertilizer dynamics and nitrogen (N) budget as well as the period after maize harvest for which palisadegrass continues to grow remain unclear. Thus, we conducted field studies to determine crop growth, end-season biomass, N fertilizer recovery, and overall N budget between an intercrop and a monoculture at two different sites during conventional and late-planted maize seasons. The cropping systems evaluated were maize and palisadegrass in monocultures and two intercrop patterns, serving as cover crop or forage with simulated grazing. From planting to grain harvest, intercrop patterns did not affect grain yield, final N content, and N fertilizer dynamics. Post-harvest, palisadegrass from intercrop patterns improved biomass from 1 to 10 Mg ha−1 and N content from 8 to 300 kg ha−1, relative to fallow after maize monoculture. Contribution of palisadegrass intercropping on N fertilizer recovery was low at approximately 4.5 kg ha-1 when both the crops were growing simultaneously and approximately 2.4 kg ha−1 following maize grain harvest. In three out of four sites over 2 years, intercrop patterns did not affect total N fertilizer recovery compared with their monocultures, averaging at approximately 51 %. Advantages of maize-palisadegrass intercropping on biomass, yield, and N cycling were documented at the site where maize was planted during the conventional season, despite the yearly variation in weather conditions. A negative N budget of −230 kg ha−1 was estimated when grazing was simulated during the conventional maize planting season, suggesting greater N requirements of the intercropped palisadegrass when serving as forage. © 2020	Article	Scopus

Foliar Se application at high concentrations is toxic to plants due to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study characterized Se toxicity symptoms using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique in response to foliar Se application in cowpea plants. Five Se concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50, 100 e 150 g ha−1) were sprayed on leaves as sodium selenate. The visual symptoms of Se toxicity in cowpea leaves were separated into two stages: I) necrotic points with an irregular distribution and internerval chlorosis at the leaf limb border (50–100 g ha−1); II) total chlorosis with the formation of dark brown necrotic lesions (150 g ha−1). Foliar Se application at 50 g ha−1 increased photosynthetic pigments and yield. Ultrastructural analyses showed that Se foliar application above 50 g ha−1 disarranged the upper epidermis of cowpea leaves. Furthermore, Se application above 100 g ha−1 significantly increased the hydrogen peroxide concentration and lipid peroxidation inducing necrotic leaf lesions. Mapping of the elements in leaves using the XRF revealed high Se intensity, specifically in leaf necrotic lesions accompanied by calcium (Ca) as a possible attenuating mechanism of plant stress. The distribution of Se intensities in the seeds was homogeneous, without specific accumulation sites. Phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) were found primarily located in the embryonic region. Understanding the factors involved in Se accumulation and its interaction with Ca support new preventive measurement technologies to prevent Se toxicity in plants. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	Article	Scopus

First, we observe that Triton HW 1000 surfactant at 0.01 vol% reduces droplets contact angle and increases their drying time. Under greenhouse conditions, the foliar treatments do not affect chlorophyll content, plant height, number of leaves, number of pods, number of seeds per pod, and average seed weight. However, the treatments induce phytotoxicity since foliar injuries appear after the spraying. Microprobe X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy combined to scanning electron microscopy shows that the leaf lesions are positively correlated to accumulation of Ce and La on the leaf surface and also promote structural alteration to the epidermal cells. X-ray absorption near edge structure shows that the La and Ce nitrates are partially bio transformed into oxides by the leaves which might explain the harmful effects. © 2020	Article	Scopus

This study aims on investigating the potential for the use of biological agents that can fix atmospheric N and are related to multiple mechanisms benefits to improve cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) development and productivity, leading to a positive residual effect on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) development. The study was set up under a no-till system in a Rhodic Haplustox, in a randomized complete block design, with four replicates. Treatments were tested in a full factorial design and included: i) three types of inoculation (without inoculation – control; Bradyrhizobium sp. inoculation (strains SEMIA 6462 and SEMIA 6463) – the conventional inoculation of cowpea; and Bradyrhizobium sp. combined with A. brasilense (strains Ab-V5 and Ab-V6) – the co-inoculation); and ii) five N rates (0 to 160 kg N ha−1) applied as urea-15N isotope. The residual effects of inoculations and N application rates applied during the cowpea growing season were evaluated on wheat (successor crop). Co-inoculation was found to increase cowpea grain yield by 40.5% and 14.1% compared to the control and Bradyrhizobium sp. inoculation when N was omitted and up to 37.6% and 50.8% when N was applied. Co-inoculation increased N use efficiency, N recovery and N accumulation on cowpea, leading to improved crop growth. The co-inoculation also provided a positive residual effect on wheat resulting in increased plant N accumulation, crop development, and greater wheat grain yield compared to the control (increase of 7.8%) and Bradyrhizobium sp. inoculated plants (increase of 5.8%). Co-inoculation was found to increase N use efficiency on cowpea by 216.5% and 35.5% and on wheat by 159.3% and 29.5% compared to control and Bradyrhizobium sp. inoculation, respectively. The fertilizer N recovery was, on average, 22.2% by cowpea, while fertilizer N recovery by wheat was <2.3%. The percentage of N accumulated on cowpea was on average 30.8%, while the residual cowpea N contribution to wheat provided by co-inoculation was 18.6%. This study showed positive improvements in cowpea-wheat growth production parameters and N management as a result of co-inoculation, indicating that there is an opportunity to reduce N fertilizer input with the combined use of biological agents that promote plant growth and chemical fertilizers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

It can be degraded through the preparation and extraction of the tested sample, leading to inaccurate quantification of FG content in animal diets. The primary size of the laboratory samples, the particle size of the analytical samples, and interval of time between grinding and solvent extraction were tested as uncertainties of the sample preparations. The efficiency of extraction, accuracy, linearity, matrix effects, limits of detection and quantification were assessed in the chemical analysis. The chemical analysis contributes as a minor source of uncertainty in analysis, despite the occurrence of matrix effects. Solvent soaking time can be considered as an effective uncertainty source; at least 16 h of soaking in acetone should be applied to extract FG from glands. Trueness and precision are the accuracy parameters most affected in the steps prior to the chemical analysis. The reduction of particle size as the increase of the interval of time between grinding and chemical analysis affected the trueness of results. On the other hand, precision was affected by the sample size of analytical and laboratory sample preparation. The best practices to reduce the uncertainty in FG analysis increase the confidence of cottonseed use as an animal feed source regarding its toxicity, improving animal health and the safety of animal products intended to human consumption. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

For this reason, to avoid risks to humans and environmental health, regulatory legislation and guidelines have been established based on extensive toxicological data. However, most of what is known in this field come from works on microcystin (MC) variants, which effects were almost exclusively tested in metazoan models. In this work, we used acute end-point toxicological assays and high-resolution hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled with electrospray ionization source (ESI-Q-TOF-MS) analyses to evaluate the deleterious impact of aqueous extracts prepared from cultures of cyanobacteria and environmental bloom biomasses over a non-metazoan model organism, the cosmopolitan fresh/brackish water unicellular microeukaryote, Paramecium caudatum (Ciliophora). Our data suggest that all extracts produced time-dependent effects on P. caudatum survival, irrespective of their metabolite profile; and that this ciliate is more sensitive to extracts containing microginins than to extracts with only MCs, stressing that more toxicological investigations should be performed on the environmental impact of neglected cyanotoxins. Further, our data provide evidence that P. caudatum may be more sensitive to cyanotoxins than vertebrates, indicating that guidelines values, set on metazoans are likely to be inaccurate to protect organisms from basal food web positions. Thus, we highly recommend the widespread use of microeukaryotes, such as ciliates in environmental risk assessment frameworks for the establishment of more reliable cyanotoxin monitoring guideline values. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In this study we hypothesized that analysis of the pedological cover combining soil phytolith assemblages and pedological, geochemical and isotopic analyses (δ13C and 14C) allows the reconstruction of events associated with the soil-landscape relationship at a toposequence scale. Soil profiles were collected from a toposequence in the upper montane environment of Mantiqueira Range, Espírito Santo State, in the Southeastern region of Brazil. Samples were collected by horizon/layer for pedological and geochemical analysis, and by depth, at 10-cm intervals, for phytolith and carbon (C) isotope (14C and δ13C) analysis. The soils are characterized by high organic matter contents, favored by the cold and humid climate, which is typical of the upland mountainous environments of Mantiqueira Range. The multiproxy approach provided important information about the paleoenvironmental conditions during the pedogenesis process, allowing to establish pedochronostratigraphic correlations, that improved the understanding of soil-landscape relationships in these environments. Soil-preserved phytolith assemblages, isotopic composition (δ13C) and organic matter dating (14C) indicated variations in the type of plant communities in the studied soils, suggesting climatic changes that influenced the soil formation and evolution. The soils experienced different pedogenesis conditions during the Late Holocene, and are, therefore, considered polygenetic soils. In summary, 3 environmental moments were identified by multiproxy analysis: Phase I (before −2330 cal. yr BP), hotter and drier than the current period; Phase II (from −2330 to −2063 cal. yr BP), colder and wetter than the current period; Phase III (after −2063 cal. yr BP), during which the current climate conditions were established. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Animals risen in the biomes Amazônia, Caatinga, Cerrado, Pampa and Pantanal were selected for this study. Beef samples were analyzed for their elemental content by neutron activation analysis and classified according to their origin by three machine learning algorithms (Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest and Classification and Regression Tree). Significant differences (p < 0.0001) were observed between the beef elemental content from the different biomes for all multivariate contrasts using NPMANOVA. The highest classification performance was obtained for the biomes Amazônia and Caatinga using Multilayer Perceptron. Results showed the feasibility of combining trace element content and machine learning approaches for the Brazilian beef traceability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

ZnO-coating can provide this nutrient to plants from the early stages of growth. However, there is a pressing need for additional studies to enable its safe use. This study aimed to evaluate the elemental distribution over ZnO-Treated maize seeds stored for up to 12 months, as well as to map Zn species in the internal seed tissues. Synchrotron radiation micro-X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (SR μ-XRF) and micro-X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (μ-XANES) were used as analytical tools for this purpose. The highest Zn accumulation site in micro-sized ZnO treated maize seeds is the embryo, mainly close to the black layer. The distribution pattern of Zn, S and P does not change in maize seeds treated with ZnO. Zn mass fractions in the embryo, pericarp and endosperm suggest that after 12 months of storage, Zn absorption is observed in ZnO-Treated seeds. In the Zn hotspot, this element is in the form of phytate and in more readily bioavailable forms, such as Zn3(PO4)2 and cysteine. These findings can yield valuable insights into the advantages of using advanced microanalytical tools to provide important information regarding potential nutrient bioavailability to those interested in biofortification studies.

In many cases the cells can generate high biomass yield under mixotrophy, which is highly desirable for future massive applications of microalgae biomass as industrial feedstock. However, there is no complete understanding of the molecular physiology of microalgae in mixotrophy. Therefore, we performed a time-series analysis of the proteome and transcriptome of Chlorella vulgaris during the transition from autotrophy to mixotrophy under continuous light, and then to heterotrophy in darkness in controlled bioreactor conditions. The results from biomass and cell growth characterization demonstrated that under mixotrophic growth the cells have enhanced growth rate, and transcriptomics data showed overexpressed genes related to chromosome organization, DNA-repair, and DNA replication. Moreover, our proteomics data revealed differentially expressed proteins and overrepresentation of proteins related to translation mechanism. The transcriptomics and proteomics analysis also indicated that the expression of genes of the glyoxylate cycle, oxylipin metabolism, myo-inositol synthesis pathway and a subset of thioredoxins were also modulated. Moreover, we performed the annotation of transcription factor and transcriptional regulator genes and the results revealed novel candidate regulator genes that were exclusively expressed during mixotrophic growth phase including members of MYB (V-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog) and bZIP (Basic Leucine Zipper) protein families. Thus, our findings indicated that the high specific growth rate observed in cells under mixotrophy is likely supported by the induction of abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms via inositol and its derivatives and increased resistance to oxidative stress through the modulation of the expression of thioredoxins. Therefore, the identification of novel candidate genes in mixotrophy may contribute to the development of microalgae strains with higher growth capacity and better performance for biomass production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Merr.), to explain any differences in the yields. Two soybean field experiments were established in Brazil, one conducted in a tropical (Trop) zone located at Cerrado Biome and the other in a subtropical (Subt) environment. The experimental design was a 2-factor in randomized complete block with four replications. Five doses of N (0, 20, 40, 80 and 120 kg ha−1) were applied at two soybean growth stages (VE and R3). For all treatments, except No-N, 15N-labelled fertilizer was used. The N uptake and the amount of N fertilizer were analysed in the roots, shoots, grains and whole plant, the FRE and yield by soybean, and the residual of fertilizer in the soil. The total N uptake (Nplant) was greater with fertilization at R3 stage compared to the other stage, and N application increased the yield just at this stage and in the Trop condition. The increase in N shoot (not specifically from fertilizer) with the application at R3 appeared to be related to the increased in yield. However, the N from fertilizer found in the plant shoot was about 20% higher when fertilizer was applied at VE compared with R3. Under Subt condition, the FRE averaging 55%. In contrast, the FRE decreased from low to high nitrogen rates (64 to 40%, respectively) when soybean grown under Trop condition. Most N from fertilizer (38%) was found in the grains, followed by the shoot (14.6%) and the root (0.58%). The use of N fertilizer at reproductive growth stages is a better approach to meet soybean N demand through N fertilization. Potential yield gains are more reliable under Trop condition. © 2020, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.	Article	Scopus

This work aimed at assessing the performance of the individual and combined use of vis-NIR and XRF sensors to predict clay, organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, base saturation (V), and extractable (ex-) nutrients (ex-P, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg) in Brazilian tropical soils. Individual models using the data of each sensor alone were calibrated using multiple linear regressions (MLR) for the XRF data, and partial least squares (PLS) regressions for the vis-NIR data. Six data fusion approaches were evaluated and compared against individual models using relative improvement (RI). The data fusion approaches included (i) two spectra fusion approaches, which simply combined the data of both sensors in a merged dataset, followed by support vector machine (SF-SVM) and PLS (SF-PLS) regression analysis; (ii) two model averaging approaches using the Granger and Ramanathan (GR) method; and (iii) two data fusion methods based on least squares (LS) modeling. For the GR and LS approaches, two different combinations of inputs were used for MLR. The GR2 and LS2 used the prediction of individual sensors, whereas the GR3 and LS3 used the individual sensors prediction plus the SF-PLS prediction. The individual vis-NIR models showed the best results for clay and OM prediction (RPD ≥ 2.61), while the individual XRF models exhibited the best predictive models for CEC, V, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg (RPD ≥ 2.57). For eight out of nine soil attributes studied (clay, CEC, pH, V, ex-P, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg), the combined use of vis-NIR and XRF sensors using at least one of the six data fusion approaches improved the accuracy of the predictions (with RI ranging from 1 to 21%). In general, the LS3 model averaging approach stood out as the data fusion method with the greatest number of attributes with positive RI (six attributes; namely, clay, CEC, pH, ex-P, ex-K, and ex-Mg). Meanwhile, no single approach was capable of exploiting the synergism between sensors for all attributes of interest, suggesting that the selection of the best data fusion approach should be attribute-specific. The results presented in this work evidenced the complementarity of XRF and vis-NIR sensors to predict fertility attributes in tropical soils, and encourage further research to find a generalized method of data fusion of both sensors data. © 2020 by the authors.

The range between optimal and toxic concentration of Se is narrow and varies among plant species. This study aimed to evaluate the phenotypic, physiological and biochemical responses of four rice genotypes (BRS Esmeralda, BRSMG Relâmpago, BRS Bonança and Bico Ganga) grown hydroponically treated with sodium selenate (1.5 mM L−1). Selenium treated plants showed a dramatically decrease of soluble proteins, chlorophylls, and carotenoids concentration, resulting in the visual symptoms of toxicity characterized as leaf chlorosis and necrosis. Selenium toxicity caused a decrease on shoot and root dry weight of rice plants. Excess Se increased the oxidative stress monitored by the levels of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation. The enzymatic antioxidant system (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and ascorbate peroxidase) increased in response to Se supply. Interestingly, primary metabolism compounds such as sucrose, total sugars, nitrate, ammonia and amino acids increased in Se-treated plants. The increase in these metabolites may indicate a defense mechanism for the osmotic readjustment of rice plants to mitigate the toxicity caused by Se. However, these metabolites were not effective to minimize the damages on phenotypic traits such as leaf chlorosis and reduced shoot and root dry weight in response to excess Se. Increased sugars profile combined with antioxidant enzymes activities can be an effective biomarkers to indicate stress induced by Se in rice plants. This study shows the physiological attributes that must be taken into account for success in the sustainable cultivation of rice in environments containing excess Se. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, the main drivers of tropical tree death remain largely unknown. Here we present a pan-Amazonian assessment of how and why trees die, analysing over 120,000 trees representing > 3800 species from 189 long-term RAINFOR forest plots. While tree mortality rates vary greatly Amazon-wide, on average trees are as likely to die standing as they are broken or uprooted—modes of death with different ecological consequences. Species-level growth rate is the single most important predictor of tree death in Amazonia, with faster-growing species being at higher risk. Within species, however, the slowest-growing trees are at greatest risk while the effect of tree size varies across the basin. In the driest Amazonian region species-level bioclimatic distributional patterns also predict the risk of death, suggesting that these forests are experiencing climatic conditions beyond their adaptative limits. These results provide not only a holistic pan-Amazonian picture of tree death but large-scale evidence for the overarching importance of the growth–survival trade-off in driving tropical tree mortality. © 2020, The Author(s).

Among these, microginins attract attention for being peptides which inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme, turning them into potential targets for hypertension and congestive heart failure treatment. This work describes a rapid and sensitive method for untarget screening of microginins in cyanobacteria extracts by LC-QqQ-MS/MS. These compounds are mostly characterized by containing 3-amino-2-hydroxy-decanoic acid at the N-terminus, which often could be chlorinated, dichlorinated or methylated. Based on the fragment ion arising from this decanoic acid derivative, a precursor ion scan (PIS) strategy has been proposed. This approach identified suspect microginins in cyanobacterial strains and environmental samples that were later confirmed by LC-QTOF-MS/MS. Eight new microginins structures were characterized based on the obtained fragmentation spectra from a total of 19 variants detected. This study highlights the applicability of PIS mode acquisition for untarget screening, detecting a wide variety of microginins with amino acids modifications, produced mainly by Microcystis aeruginosa strains. This method is a useful tool for the identification and environmental monitoring of molecules with conserved molecular substructures that possess similar fragmentation pattern. © This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License.

G27-60 and G65-65 (GenBank accession codes JF766998 and JF767007, respectively) are promising anti-proliferation agents against human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2-C3A) cells. However, the literature fails to describe the effects of Diaporthe exopolysaccharides (EPS) on eukaryotic healthy cells. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae has been employed as model-system to evaluate the toxicity of pharmaceutical and agricultural-interest substances, taking into account, among other parameters, the speed of conidia germination. Current study verified the effect of different concentrations of Diaporthe β-glucans on the germination speed of M. anisopliae. Conidia were incubated with β-glucans treatments (50, 200 and 400 μg/mL) at 28ºC, sampled during 24 h and analyzed by light microscopy. At the end of a 24-h incubation, the amount of germinated conidia reached ≈99% for controls and ranged between 97.7 and 98.6% for treatments. Bayesian analysis indicated that Diaporthe glucans had no toxicity on M. anisopliae and the curve of germination occurred as expected for this fungal strain. Considering the validity of filamentous fungi as model-systems, results are important data on the toxicity of endophytic EPS on healthy cells and may be associated with our previous results obtained for these polymers against tumor cells. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Uberlandia.

The purpose of the conversion of these systems is to obtain benefits related to the improvement of soil and environmental quality, minimizing the effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially carbon dioxide (CO2). In this context, this study aimed to investigate the effect of burned and unburned sugarcane harvesting systems on soil CO2 emission and soil chemical, physical, and microbiological attributes. Two adjacent areas were used in this study: an unburned sugarcane area, with an eight-year history without burning the sugarcane field and high amounts of crop residues (mean of 13 t ha−1), and a burned sugarcane area, with manual harvesting after burning the sugarcane field and without crop residues on the soil surface. The soil of both areas is classified as an Oxisol. Soil CO2 emission, soil temperature, and soil moisture were assessed from 20 randomly sampling points placed in each area. Soil samples were collected at the end of the soil CO2 emission, soil temperature, and soil moisture assessments from each point at a depth of 0–0.20 m to determine soil physical, chemical, and microbiological attributes. Soil CO2 emission was, on average, 37% higher in the burned sugarcane area (2.63 µmol m−2 s−1) compared to the unburned sugarcane area (1.92 µmol m−2 s−1). Soil moisture was higher in the unburned sugarcane area (25.30%) than in the burned sugarcane area (16.02%). An opposite effect was observed for soil temperature, which presented values 2.5 °C higher in the burned sugarcane area (21.5 °C) compared to the unburned sugarcane area (19.1 °C). Soil carbon decay constant k indicated that carbon was decomposed faster in the burned sugarcane area (0.00070 days−1) than in the unburned sugarcane area (0.00046 days−1). Thus, soil carbon half-life was longer in the unburned sugarcane area (1,572.82 days) compared to the burned sugarcane area (1,033.95 days), i.e., carbon permanence time in the unburned sugarcane area was 52% higher than in the burned sugarcane area. Soil temperature, soil moisture, air-filled pore space, P, the sum of bases (Ca2+ + K+ + Mg2+), soil bulk density, soil carbon stock, soil C/N ratio, and the abundance of functional gene nifH are the most representative soil attributes that allows characterizing the CO2 emission process in soils managed with sugarcane under unburned and burned harvesting systems. Therefore, the study of these attributes should be taken into account when assessing the variability of CO2 emissions in agricultural soils. In conservationist terms, the unburned sugarcane system presents a higher potential for stabilizing soil carbon and reducing the contribution of agriculture to greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2, when compared to the burned sugarcane system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Such changes in the Amazon region have been detected, for instance, by comparing the natural carbon (13C:12C) and nitrogen (15N:14N) isotopic ratios of people living in riverine communities with urban dwellers their putative diet. In this study, we considered how landscape variables impacted food consumption by comparing fingernail isotopic ratios of individuals in the rural settlement of Costa do Caldeirão located in the floodplain (várzea) of the Solimões River, and in the rural settlement of Paquequer located in a non-flooded area (terra-firme) near the Madeira River banks. A total of 70 fingernails were sampled for carbon and nitrogen isotopic analysis during the low water period and again during the high water period from the same residents of the várzea and terra-firme. The consumption of C4-like resources (e.g., frozen chicken and canned meat) increased in both rural settlements during the high water period when C3-like resources (fish, cassava, rice, beans) are less available due to the flooding of lowland areas, but this difference was more pronounced in the terra-firme. The higher consumption of C4-like resources in the várzea compared to the terra-firme shows how seasonal flooding is a key factor influencing food security and health, due to stark variations in river water levels. While fish and farinha are still important staple foods, differences within rural settlements suggest that, besides seasonal variation and changes in water levels, other factors such as age, origin, and income may be crucial to understanding individual dietary behavior change in line with the nutritional transition model. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Different mechanisms are responsible for tolerance to heat stress (HS) including coat and skin colour, body size, fat distribution, physiological reactions and not just coat type (hair/wool). This review looks at physical, physiological, molecular and genetic aspects of heat tolerance in sheep and how they affect hair and wool sheep. We propose that it is the adaptation to hot environments and not the type of coat (wool/hair) itself that determines the capacity of the resistance of the animal to HS, due to modifications in essential pathways such as energy metabolism, physiological responses and body size. When studied in similar environments, commercial wool breeds tend to show higher heat stress, but hair breeds tend not to differ from wool breeds that are adapted to hot environments. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

We explored floral anatomy and development in two Aechmea spp. belonging to different subgenera to contribute useful information on reproductive biology and taxonomy. We examined floral buds using scanning electron and light microscopy to characterize the development of septal nectaries, petal appendages, ovules, stamens and carpels. In A. gamosepala, we confirmed that the petal appendages develop late, whereas in A. correia-araujoi they develop earlier during floral development. Petal appendage formation included positional changes, possibly affecting floral attributes and visitation by insects, rather than vertebrates. Nectar is released through three basal orifices distally on the ovary, and here we document the link between the nectary region, through discrete canals, upward to the conduplicate lobes of the wet stigma. Improved understanding of the floral development and morphology of Aechmea may help to explain the existence of polymorphic flowers in this genus and may have implications for studies on interactions with pollinators and systematics. © 2020 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2020, 194, 221-238	Article	Scopus

Subjects were divided into four groups and samples were collected twice: at first rehabilitation by removable partial (A) and total (C) dental prostheses, and replacement of the removable partial (B) and total (D) prostheses. Yeasts were genotyped using DNA microsatellite markers. Microbiological methods were used to screen for azole antifungal resistance and exoenzyme production. In the initial sampling, oral colonization by Candida was observed in 31 (53.4%) subjects in groups A (33.3%), B (68.2%), and D (65%); 20 (47.6%) subjects displayed colonization of prostheses: groups B (50%) and D (45%). The second sampling (±30 days) revealed Candida in 2 (3.4%: oral cavity) and 4 (6.9%: prosthetic) subjects from group B. C. albicans and C. dubliniensis displayed both polyclonal and monoclonal patterns of infection. Azole-resistant C. albicans and SAPs+ strains were prevalent. Related strains were found in one or several oral sites (mucosa and prosthesis), as well as intra- and inter-subject, -gender, -group, and –time of sampling. However, the patterns of clonality can be altered under dental care. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

These applications are relevant for the quality control of commercial fuels, to estimate transesterification reaction yields and to detect product adulteration. The proposed method is based on the differences in solubility of biodiesel and either diesel or vegetable oils in an aqueous-ethanol medium. From samples dissolved in ethanol, the volumes of the aqueous-ethanol solution required to achieve a cloudy suspension are taken as analytical signals and directly correlated to the biodiesel amount in the samples. For biodiesel:diesel samples, a linear response was obtained from 7.0 to 25.0% (v/v), whereas two linear ranges, 20.0–50.0% (v/v) and 50.0–80.0% (v/v), were established for biodiesel:vegetable oil samples, depending on the water content in the titrant. For biodiesel:diesel blends, the coefficient of variation (n = 10) and the detection limit (99.7% confidence level) were estimated at 6.8% and 2.5% (v/v), respectively, and the corresponding values for the biodiesel:vegetable oil mixtures were 5.8% and 7.0% (v/v). The procedure takes 5 min and generates 10 mL of waste per determination. Results agreed with those attained by a flow-based spectrophotometric reference procedure at the 95% confidence level, as evaluated by a paired t-test and the elliptical joint confidence region test. The proposed method is a fast, practical, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly alternative for routine analysis, including point-of-care determinations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

This research aimed to evaluate N fertilization management (split, incorporated, and broadcast application) and fertilizer blends (30%PSCU + 70%U and 70%PSCU + 30%U) on volatilization of ammonia (AV) and soil N mineral content (NM); plant N uptake (NU) and15N-fertilizer recovery (NR); and yield (GY). Field experiments were conducted for two growing seasons (2017–2018 and 2019–2020) in Rhodic Eutrustox soil. U was treated with NBPT (N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide). N rate was 180 kg ha−1 . AV reached 12% of the applied N (broadcast-applied 70%PSCU + 30%U, 2017–2018). The 30%PSCU + 70%U application resulted in higher NM at 40–60 cm depth in vegetative and reproductive stages in both seasons. The 70%PSCU + 30%U application resulted in the highest GY in 2017–2018, and the N treatments did not affect GY in 2019–2020. NR was 3% on average at vegetative leaf stage 4 (V4), and PSCU, the main N-fertilizer supplier applying 70%PSCU + 30%U. After V4, the main N-fertilizer supplier is PSCU for 70%PSCU + 30%U and U for 30%PSCU + 70%U application. These blends (incorporated, broadcast, and split application) can ensure N during the maize growth cycle, with NR of 72.5% at maturity (R6) being 47.9% in the grain. © 2020 by the authors.

Field capacity (FC) is an important parameter in this context and its proper determination allows the use of simple models to assess soil water balance components. In this study we aimed estimation and mapping of FC in Brazilian soils based on available soil global data and pedotransfer functions (PTF). Soil basic data were obtained from the SoilGrids system in a 0.05 × 0.05° spatial grid covering the Brazilian territory, with a resolution of approximately 5 km. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and water retention curve (SWRC) were estimated by PTFs and used as input in the agro-hydrological model SWAP to simulate an internal drainage experiment without evapotranspiration, until the drainage at the bottom profile reached negligible flux density values (qfc) of: 0.25, 1.0 and 4.0 mm d−1, considered to correspond to FC. Simulations were performed considering three soil depths (zfc) of 30, 60 and 100 cm. FC was classified according to major soil textural and pedological classes. Uncertainty was evaluated by the sensitivity of the model to the soil hydraulic properties and the grid cell size. The highest soil matric potential at FC (hfc) was observed for loam texture while the lowest hfc was observed for sandy loam texture. Between soil pedological classes, Gleysols presented the lowest hfc. The results showed that FC estimation is sensitive to zfc and qfc. Spatial agreement between patterns of Ks, FC and soil class were observed according to the evaluated database. The qfc value of 4.0 mm d−1 presented reasonable results for estimating FC in Brazilian soils, in agreement with expected drainage time following saturation, with average values below 4 days for the evaluated depths and hfc around −30 cm. Estimation of FC with PTF showed underestimation of hfc varying from double to almost fourfolds times. The usually adopted hfc of −330 cm does not represent the FC for Brazilian soils. Furthermore, a qfc lower than 1.0 mm d−1 did not yield usable values for FC. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

The objective was to evaluate the effect of using different combinations of plant species from different botanical families in rotation and succession of soil cover crops in NTS for onion production on formation of macroaggregates, mesoaggregates, and microaggregates, and on total organic C (TOC) and N (TN) contents, including isotopic forms of C and N, in soil aggregates and bulk soil. The treatments (T) evaluated were maize/onion (NTS-T1) cover plants (winter)/onion (NTS-T2) maize/winter grasses/onion (NTS-T3) velvet bean/onion (NTS-T4) millet/cover plants (winter)/onion (NTS-T5) velvet bean/rye/onion (NTS-T6) maize/onion in conventional tillage system (CTS-T7) and intercrop cover plants (summer)/onion (NTS-T8). We evaluated macroaggregates (8.0-0.25 mm), microaggregates (<0.25 mm), and bulk soil (<2.0 mm) at depths of 0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm, in a nine-year field experiment. The greater plant diversity in T2-T6 and T8 resulted in higher geometric mean diameter (GMD) of aggregates compared to T1 and T7. The T8 was more efficient in increasing GMD in the 10-20 cm soil depth than the other treatments. The T1 was more efficient in improving the evaluated soil physical and chemical attributes than T7. The use of NTS with plants of the Poaceae and Fabaceae families in single or intercrop systems for onion production resulted in higher TOC and TN contents in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm soil depths compared to CTS. Isotope 15N measurements showed that C and N were more protected in microaggregates in all evaluated treatments and depths compared to macroaggregates and bulk soil. Macroaggregates had more TOC and TN than microaggregates.  © 2020 CSIRO.	Article	Scopus

The objective of this study was to evaluate the sorption–desorption process of aminocyclopyrachlor in soils with the addition of three aged organic materials from sugar cane and their transport via leaching. Sugar cane straw (12 t/ha), filter cake (90 t/ha) and vinasse (200 m3/ha) were added to a clayey soil 15, 30 and 60 days before herbicide application. Sorption and desorption were evaluated by the batch equilibrium method. For leaching assessments, the materials were applied to the soil surface. Sorption was relatively low in all treatments (Kd = 0.17–0.41 L/kg), although significantly higher in soil without organic material addition. A negative correlation between herbicide sorption and increased soil base saturation was observed, indicating competition for sorption sites. With the addition of vinasse, 71% of the herbicide reached the leachate, while '50% reached the leachate in the other treatments. Aminocyclopyrachlor availability was not reduced with organic material addition to the soil, which may be favourable for weed control. However, the presence of vinasse leads to the risk of leaching to deeper soil layers than the seed bank. © 2020 European Weed Research Society	Article	Scopus

A single application of a blend of polymer-sulfur coated urea (PSCU) and conventional urea (U) treated with NBPT (N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide) can meet that demand. Broadcast application could improve yield than other N management practices. This research evaluated two blends (70%PSCU + 30%U and 30%PSCU + 70%U) and three N fertilization managements (incorporated, broadcast, and split application) on soil ammonia volatilization (AV) and N mineral content (NM); plant N uptake (NU) and15 N recovery from U (NUR); and yield (GY). Irrigated field experiments were conducted in 2018 and 2019 in Rhodic Eutrustox soil. The N application rate was 90 kg ha−1 . AV reached 12% (30%PSCU + 70%U, broadcast application) and 14% of the applied N (split application at the third trifoliate leaf unfolded stage (V4)). The incorporated application resulted in higher NM in the vegetative and reproductive stages than the other management practices. Broadcast application resulted in higher NU than split application at physiological maturity. Split application resulted in higher NUR (grain) and GY than broadcast application. There was a positive correlation between NUR (grain) and GY in all N fertilization management treatments. The NUR values reached 48% (30%PSCU + 70%U) and 18% (70%PSCU + 30%U). Split N application using these blends can improve NUR in grain and GY compared to broadcast application in Rhodic Eutrustox soil. This information can help farmers improve the fertilization management practices used with these blends, and thereby avoid economic losses and environmental pollution. © 2020 by the authors.

Merrill): In Vivo Investigations of Transport, Chemical Speciation, and Leaf Surface Changes	2020	Journal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition	20	4		2731	2739	8	10.1007/s42729-020-00338-3	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091057798&doi=10.1007%2fs42729-020-00338-3&partnerID=40&md5=a3646fb3b1ed178923ac5475e939ddd8	Due to a zinc-deficient diet, about 800,000 children die each year worldwide. This aspect is amended by exploiting foliar fertilization, a useful alternative to improve crop yield and nutritional quality of food crops. The aim of this study was then to investigate the leaf uptake and transport of zinc by soybean (Glycine max (L) Merrill). Plant leaves were treated with Zn phosphite and Zn ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) commercial formulations. X-ray spectroscopy (XRF and XANES) was exploited to trace nutrient movement in the petiolule and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate the influence of leaf surface treatments. No radiation damage, in terms of elemental redistribution, was observed during the XRF and XANES measurements. As an alternative to radioisotopes, XRF allowed to detect the movement of Zn from both sources in the plant petiolule. Both fertilizers disintegrated leaf epicuticular wax crystals, yet accumulation of sediments in the vicinity of stomata was noted only for Zn phosphite. Absorption and redistribution of Zn were higher for plants that received Zn phosphite. Zinc supplied as Zn phosphite was transported in a form different from that of the pristine Zn phosphite, whereas Zn supplied as Zn EDTA was transported in its chelated form. © 2020, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.

Among the cover crops, some legume species are must chosen due to their abilities to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N) into the soil, which increases soil N availability for the cash crop planted subsequently. Our hypothesis was that planting a legume within the sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) renewal period can be adopted as a strategy to supply the N required for the sugarcane at planting. The hypothesis was tested through an experiment set up within Southeast Brazil into two adjacent areas: in an area sunn hemp (Crotalaria junceae L.) was planted within the sugarcane renewal period (rotation system), whereas the another area was left in fallow (fallow system). Five N-fertilizer rates: 0, 130, 260, 390, and 520 kg N ha-1 were arranged in a randomized block design with four replications within both systems. The N amounts were divided throughout the plant cane, first and second ratoons cycles. Plant parameters evaluated included: tillering, stalk yield and stalk industrial quality. The N content on leaves as well as the inorganic N dynamic on soil were also evaluated. Overall, sunn hemp cropped within the sugarcane renewal period potentially replaces 60 kg ha-1 of N at sugarcane planting. Moreover, the rotation system enhanced stalk yield in 20 Mg ha-1 over both ratoon cycles, whereas the N amount required for each Mg of stalk harvested is reduced by 12.5%, indicating augmented the nitrogen recovering (NUE). The sucrose content and sugar yield are both enhanced under rotation system. However, soil N inorganic dynamic, the N content on leaves and amounts removed on plant components were little sensitive to the rotation system. Our findings highlight the rotation system as a feasible alternative to replace part of the N required by the sugarcane, which improves the NUE for the crop. Conclusions from this study indicate that legume rotation system adoption increases the sustainability of bioenergy from sugarcane by reducing the dependency on synthetic N fertilizers. © 2020	Article	Scopus

Considering that CH4 emissions are dependent on the structure and abundance of microbial communities, we hypothesized that different vinasse transportation systems would harbor different microbial community composition, resulting in distinct CH4 patterns. To test this hypothesis, we used high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing with real-time PCR to evaluate the composition and abundance of microorganisms in the two main systems of vinasse storage and transportation (i.e. open channels and tanks systems) in Brazil. Our results showed higher microbial diversity and CH4 emissions in channel system, especially in the uncoated section. Significant differences in microbial community structure, diversity, and abundance between the uncoated/coated open channel and tanks indicated a clear selection at taxonomic and functional levels, especially in relation to CH4 production. These responses included higher methanogens diversity in the uncoated section of the channel and are in agreement with the methanogen abundance determined by mcrA and mba genes copy number (1.5 × 107 and 4.3 × 1010) and subsequent positive correlation with CH4 emissions (R2 = 0.8). The most representative methanogen genus across the samples was Methanobrevibacter. The results observed herein shows that the use of the coating in the bottom of channels and tanks prevent the growth and development of a methanogen-related community. We concluded that the improvements in vinasse storage and transportation systems would significantly change the microbial community and reduce CH4 emissions, thereby making bioethanol a greener biofuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

In order to increase fibre degradability and the efficiency of energy utilisation from low-quality forages, exogenous fibrolytic enzymes have been studied. In this assay, we evaluated the effects of increasing dose levels of fibrolytic enzymes extract (FEE) produced by Trichoderma reesei on in vitro rumen organic matter degradability, fermentation parameters, total gas and CH4 production of tropical forages. Forage samples were analysed for their bromatological composition, and enzyme activity from FEE was performed for xylanase and endoglucanase. The in vitro gas production technique was used in a 5 × 3 factorial arrangement with five FEE dose levels (0, 5, 50, 500 and 5,000 µl) and three substrates (Cynodon spp., Panicum maximum and Cenchrus ciliaris L.). The highest dose level of FEE increased degradability, total gas and CH4 production in all substrates (p '.05). Butyrate concentration also increased while acetate:propionate ratio and pH decreased with the addition of FEE (p '.05). These results indicated that the use of fibrolytic enzymes can be a reliable strategy to improve degradability of low-quality forages, contributing to the sustainability and intensification of livestock production in tropical countries. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH	Article	Scopus

Palynofacies, diatoms, and organic geochemistry (S, C/S) data from a sediment core (PR07) collected from the Jucuruçu River valley in coastal southern Bahia, northeastern Brazil were used to better understand ecosystem changes that occurred in the region during the last ~7.5k years. Elemental values (S: 0.15–5.9%; C/S: 0.12–41.5) suggest marine and fluvial influences in the valley during the Holocene, and organic matter was derived from freshwater and marine phytoplankton. The presence of heterolithic deposits, brackish/marine diatoms, predominance of amorphous group, non-opaque phytoclasts, pyrite crystals, and marine microfossils suggests that a tidal flat formed during a mid-Holocene sea-level highstand. A fluvial plain developed in the last 5k years, due to marine regression and an increase in fluvial sediment supply to the region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Being monocots, tree palms are evolutionarily, morphologically and physiologically distinct from other trees, and these differences have important consequences for ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration and storage) and in terms of responses to climate change. We quantified global patterns of tree palm relative abundance to help improve understanding of tropical forests and reduce uncertainty about these ecosystems under climate change. Location: Tropical and subtropical moist forests. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Palms (Arecaceae). Methods: We assembled a pantropical dataset of 2,548 forest plots (covering 1,191 ha) and quantified tree palm (i.e., ≥10 cm diameter at breast height) abundance relative to co-occurring non-palm trees. We compared the relative abundance of tree palms across biogeographical realms and tested for associations with palaeoclimate stability, current climate, edaphic conditions and metrics of forest structure. Results: On average, the relative abundance of tree palms was more than five times larger between Neotropical locations and other biogeographical realms. Tree palms were absent in most locations outside the Neotropics but present in >80% of Neotropical locations. The relative abundance of tree palms was more strongly associated with local conditions (e.g., higher mean annual precipitation, lower soil fertility, shallower water table and lower plot mean wood density) than metrics of long-term climate stability. Life-form diversity also influenced the patterns; palm assemblages outside the Neotropics comprise many non-tree (e.g., climbing) palms. Finally, we show that tree palms can influence estimates of above-ground biomass, but the magnitude and direction of the effect require additional work. Conclusions: Tree palms are not only quintessentially tropical, but they are also overwhelmingly Neotropical. Future work to understand the contributions of tree palms to biomass estimates and carbon cycling will be particularly crucial in Neotropical forests. © 2020 The Authors.

The correct measurement of its content has a direct impact on the profitability of the process. In this work, a diffusive micro-distillation device (DMDD) is proposed that allows the determination of ethanol directly in the fermented or distilled beverages samples. The DMDD consists of a 5 mL plastic test tube containing a reagent solution of potassium dichromate and sulfuric acid, inserted into another 50 mL polyethylene tube containing the sample. This set is heated in a water bath for 15 min at 80 °C, providing the ethanol diffusion, which reacts with the receptor solution contained in the test tube. The chromium (III) produced by the oxidation reaction, is spectrophotometrically quantified at 589 nm. The proposed procedure has a linear range between 1 and 12% (v/v) with R2 = 0.999 and RSD = 3.8% and results in agreement with those obtained by the distillation-densitometry official method. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanisms that drive this process are less well understood. In particular, it is critical to know how landscape structure modulates spillover movements, and whether species are moving through the matrix to acquire resources or simply to disperse between habitat fragments. We tested landscape effects and food resource use within cattle pasture matrices. We used mist-nets to collect data on avian communities across 51 sampling sites, spanning a forest cover gradient. We additionally integrated stable isotopic analysis (δ13C signature) to determine the provenance of resources used (either forest - dominated by C3 plants; or pasture, dominated by C4). Bird movement across pasture matrices was extremely reduced, and bird occupation was concentrated near forest edges. There was a clear distinction of resource use according to species’ habitat preferences, with forest-species foraging predominantly in-forests, open-area species in pastures, and generalist species having more varied diets, but still relying on a large proportion of C3 sources. Forest cover was unrelated to avian spillover from forests into pastures, but positively related to C3 signatures for both forest and open-area associated species. Finally, we found that most birds moving from forests to pastures were habitat generalists (63%), and that pastures work as a barrier for forest-associated species movement. Landscapes dominated by pasture are very unfavorable to the conservation of forest species, but potentially can maintain ecosystem services from the spillover of generalist species. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Aside from modelling and phylogenetic studies, this hypothesis has never been tested with empirical, fossil pollen, paleo-vegetation data. By using palynology, radiocarbon dating, and carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic analyses of organic matter, we reconstructed the vegetation dynamics and inferred climatic changes since the Late Pleistocene in the centre of this global biodiversity hotspot. Our results show that the forest biome was resilient to Last Glacial Maximum - LGM conditions, but that the floristic composition differed from that of today. Since the late glacial, the floristic composition of the dense forest changed from cold- to warm-adapted taxa. Structural, as well as floristic, changes occurred during drier conditions of the early and middle Holocene, with an opening of the forest, providing insights into the type of vegetation impacts that might be expected under predicted future drought. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Foliar application of urea combined with HS and HA offers an alternative strategy to increase nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The objective of this study was to understand the effects of foliar application of HA and HS along with urea on NUE and response of different biometric, biochemical and physiological traits of sugarcane with respect to cultivar, mode of foliar application, geographic location and intervals of foliar application. To study this, two different independent Experiments were conducted in green house facilities at two different agro-climatic zones (USA and Brazil) using two different predominant varieties, modes and intervals of foliar applications. The three different foliar applications used in this study were (1) urea (U), (2) mixture of urea and HS (U+HS) and (3) HA (U+HA). In both Experiments, 15N (nitrogen isotope) recovery or NUE was higher in U+HS followed by U+HA. However, magnitude of NUE changed according to the differences in two Experiments. Results showed that foliar application of U+HS and U+HA was rapidly absorbed and stored in the form of protein and starch. Also induced changes in photosynthesis, intrinsic water use efficiency, protein, total soluble sugars and starch signifying a synergistic effect of U+HS and U+HA on carbon and nitrogen metabolism. These results showed promising use of HS and HA with urea to improve NUE in sugarcane compared to using the urea alone.

The use of PGPB in agriculture as formulated bioinoculants is a potential approach to reduce the negative environmental impacts caused by the continuous application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The evaluation of a great number of bacteria in the laboratory for key traits involved in the improvement of plant fitness is a suitable strategy to find prospective candidates for bioinoculants. This chapter presents the main methods described in the literature to quickly screen potential candidates from a bacterial collection to directly and indirectly promote the plant growth. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

We conducted in vivo and in vitro bioassays using native Brazilian isolates of Metarhizium robertsii (ESALQ 1635), M. humberi (ESALQ 1638), and M. anisopliae (ESALQ 1669) to better understand the possible mechanisms related to plant growth promotion traits and colonization of the root system in the model pot-grown tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) miniature cultivar “Micro-Tom.” In vivo trials revealed that M. robertsii (ESALQ 1635) or M. humberi (ESALQ 1638) inoculated in tomato seedlings improved vegetative and reproductive traits. Inoculation with M. robertsii yielded taller plants, longer roots, and more shoot and root dry mass than M. humberi. The number of flowers and the fresh weight of fruits was significantly increased by M. robertsii and M. humberi inoculation, in relation to uninoculated control plants. Both fungal species endophytically colonized all tomato tissues within 30 days of inoculation. Plants inoculated with either M. robertsii or M. humberi increased auxin-induced GUS expression in the roots for up to 30 days after inoculation, confirming that Metarhizium induces auxin-regulated gene expression. We also explored the production of key compounds including enzymes, hormones, and metabolites involved in plant growth promotion. The three Metarhizium species grown with or without exogenous tryptophan were able to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) at different titers. All Metarhizium isolates produced phosphatases, phytases, siderophores, and chitinases. Of particular importance, the M. robertsii and M. humberi isolates exhibited similar in vitro biochemical profiles, whereas M. anisopliae and Trichoderma harzianum isolates demonstrated distinct traits from the others. Taken together, we argue that the M. robertsii isolate is more efficient than the M. humberi isolate to endophytically colonize tomato plants resulting in improved growth. However, M. humberi (ESALQ 1638) yielded a slightly better production of some metabolites in vitro. Thus, we propose that the isolates of M. robertsii and M. humberi could be explored as complementary plant growth promoters. © Copyright © 2020 Siqueira, Mascarin, Gonçalves, Marcon, Quecine, Figueira and Delalibera.

Thereby, this study investigates the chemical interactions between glyphosate and commercial sources of Mn, such as MnSO4, Mn–phosphite, Mn–EDTA, Mn–glycine, and MnCO3. Nearly 30% of the Mn supplied as MnSO4 and Mn–glycine precipitated with glyphosate, yielding a Mn:glyphosate solid complex with molar ratio of nearly 2:1, both presenting similar chemical environment. XANES analysis of the supernatants indicate no formation of Mn–glyphosate soluble complexes. The use of Mn–EDTA as well as the maintenance of the mixture pH below 2.5 prevented precipitation, while pH above 7 caused the formation of MnO(OH). In conclusion, the Mn source and the pH of the mixtures matter. The absence of Mn–glyphosate soluble complexes suggests that dissolved Mn and glyphosate are still able to accomplish their functions, however, the precipitation significantly decreases their active availability. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Silicon (Si) can mitigate such stress, and your supply in plants with the active absorption mechanism is carried out through roots. However, foliar spraying has been practiced to supply Si in PSS production nurseries. Althought it is known that Si via roots can alter C: N: P ratios, nothing has been reported about its supply via foliar spraying, nor whether such changes interfere with structural nutrient use efficiency and with plant physiological responses. Thus, this study aimes to asses whether Si foliar spraying changes C: N: P ratios and increases the nutritional efficiency of PSS, as well as whether water deficiency interferes with such a relationships. For these purposes, three experiments were carried out. In experiment I, treatments consisted of two sugarcane cultivars (CTC 4 and RB 966928) and three Si supply forms (in nutrient solution via roots [SiR], via foliar spraying [SiL], and one control with the absence of Si [-Si]). The same Si supply forms were used in the other two experiments. In experiment II, a short-term water deficit was induced by polyethylene glycol addition to nutrient solution (-0.6 MPa) for three days. In experiment III, a long-term water deficit was imposed using levels of soil water retention capacity (70% [no water deficit], 50% [moderate water deficit], and 30% [severe water deficit] for 30 days. Our findings revealed that Si supply decreased C concentrations regardless of water conditions and that N and P concentrations varied with Si supply form and water deficit level. Moreover, root- and foliar-applied Si modified the C: N: P stoichiometry and increased C use efficiency in PSS, which thus increased N and P use efficiencies. Such an increased nutritional performance helped adjust physiological parameters and increase dry matter yield in PSS, both under water stress and non-stress conditions. Further, Si foliar spraying promoted structural effects on PSS regardless of water conditions, even if sugarcane has an active absorption via roots. In conclusion, foliar spraying can be used to supply Si in PSS production nurseries. Copyright: © 2020 Teixeira et al.

The biochar aging period was 30 d. There was little difference between the amounts of sorbed glyphosate in Ultisol (96.8, 96.8 and 96.4%) and Alfisol (97.1, 97.5 and 97.4%) soils that were unamended or amended with biochar aged for 0 or 30 d, respectively. Similar amounts of desorbed herbicide occurred in Ultisol (3.3, 3.3 and 3.4%) and Alfisol (4.1, 4.2 and 3.9%) soils, respectively. The degradation time half-life (DT50) of glyphosate in Ultisol unamended and initial amended were higher (38 and 36 d, respectively) than DT50 in the amended soil with 30 d of biochar aging (27 d); and in the Alfisol DT50 was higher in unamended soil (38 d), and similar in soil unamended at 0 and 30 d of biochar aging (21 and 26 d, respectively). The addition of biochar to two tropical soils or its aging did not have any effect on the sorption and desorption of glyphosate and its biodegradation in relation to the unamended soils, and it can did not affect the transport and persistence of this herbicide in soil. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Most silages achieved good fermentation (pH < 4.2). Rehydrated corn had a higher pH across all storage periods evaluated and increased dry matter losses. Leuconostoc and Lactococcus were the dominant genera in fresh material, while Lactobacillus and Acetobacter were prevalent in silages. Clostridium and Enterococcus prevailed in rehydrated corn after 120 days storage, and Clostridium was highly and positively correlated with acetone, butyric acid, and 2,3-butanediol contents. The storage period and kernel maturity were the most important factors responsible for changes in the bacterial community of silages. Results confirmed the existence of a specific bacterial microbiome that was unique for each maturity and storage time. Variations in these factors also affected the fermentation quality through influencing the bacterial community. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH	Article	Scopus

Berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) hay (BH) was considered as control, or replaced at 50 % with Acacia saligna (AS), Leucaena leucocephala (LL) or Atriplex halimus (AH) on a DM basis. In Experiment 1 (in vitro evaluation), in vitro ruminal degradability, gas and CH4 production were measured. In Experiment 2 (in vivo evaluation), twelve Barki rams weighing 43.29 ± 0.13 kg were randomly assigned into 4 treatments and individually fed the BH, AS and LL diets for 30 days (21 days for adaptation, 7 days for digestibility and N balance and the subsequent 2 days for CH4 measurements). Results of Experiment 1 showed that AS, LL and AH diets decreased (P < 0.05) gas, CH4 and total protozoa compared to BH. Both AS and LL diets increased (P < 0.05) ruminal propionate and partitioning factor, while decreased, ammonia-N (NH3-N) concentrations, acetate, acetate/propionate ratio and protozoa count compared to the BH diet. In Experiment 2, the LL diet decreased (P < 0.05) dry matter intake and digestibility of crude protein compared with the BH diet. Rams fed both AS and LL diets showed greater (P < 0.05) fecal N and retained N, while decreased (P < 0.01) urinary N excretion and exhibited 11.45 % reductions in CH4 production. In conclusion, the partial replacement of BH with AS reduced N losses and CH4 emissions without negative effects on ruminal fermentation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

The samples of cherry tomatoes were submitted to gamma radiation from a source of Cobalt-60 type Gammacell-220 at doses of 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 kGy and non-irradiated samples, and stored at room temperature during maturation. Analyses of moisture content, ash content, pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids (Brix), ratio (soluble solids/titratable acidity), carotenoids, ascorbic acid - vitamin C, firmness, peel and fleshy mesocarp color - lightness (L*) and Chroma (C*) at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after irradiation (DAI) were performed. An increase of total carotenoids and weight loss has been observed as the irradiation dose increased over storage time of cherry tomatoes. The firmness of irradiated group of cherry tomatoes was lower than that of control non-irradiated from 7 DAI. Irradiation did not alter the values of ash contents (0.50–0.62%), pH (6.8–7.2), and peel color L* (32–41) of cherry tomatoes compared to non-irradiated tomatoes. The storage periods of cherry tomatoes also were responsible for the differences observed in titratable acidity, total carotenoids, vitamin C, weight loss and firmness; therefore, it was affirmed that the fruits presented behaviors equal to those expected, since during the ripening and senescence period there are changes in the physicochemical characteristics of most fruits. Thus, it was concluded that irradiation up to 1.0 kGy gamma-rays could improve sufficiently the postharvest conservation of cherry tomatoes to satisfy the consumer with acceptable nutritional quality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

For this, a field trial was conducted using six Se rates (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 g ha−1). Physiological evaluations in rice leaves, rice grain yield, and Se and other elements content were assessed. Spatial distributions of Se and other elements were visualized mapping the biofortified rice grains with μXRF. The results showed that the strategies and rates of Se applied to the plants were effective for producing Se-rich rice grains. Although Se application did not change the rice yield, it affected some enzyme activities, improving the antioxidant system of the plant. The spatial distribution of the different elements found in the biofortified rice grains varied substantially, with Se accumulations mainly in the endosperm, whereas P, K, Fe, and Zn accumulate in the embryo. Agronomic biofortification of rice with Se, via soil or leaf, is a promising strategy to be adopted in tropical soils in order to produce rice grains with adequate Se contents for human consumption. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

The mixture of atrazine + mesotrione was shown to be additive and synergistic by visual assessment in relation to expected control, depending on the dose and evaluation period. Absorption of 14C-atrazine alone (62.5%) and as a mixture (60%) in morning glory was higher than in the treatments with 14C-mesotrione alone (42.8%) and as a mixture (46.6%). However, 14C-mesotrione alone showed a higher translocation (8.6%) than 14C-mesotrione + atrazine (2.5%), indicating that the mixture decreased the translocation of this herbicide. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

Selected rhizobia isolates were compared with a reference strain CIAT899 and two controls without inoculation. Large seeds contributed for highest plant growth, nodulation and N fixation than small seeds. The isolates UFPI-59, UFPI-18 and UFPI-38 promoted the highest values of shoot and root dry weight, respectively. The isolates UFPI-32 promoted the highest values of nodule number, while UFPI-59 promoted the highest values of nodule dry weight. The isolates UFPI-38 and UFPI-59 promoted the highest accumulation of N. This study showed that seed size really influences lima bean growth, nodulation and BNF. Considering rhizobia isolates, UFPI-59, UFPI-38, and UFPI-18 contributed for plant growth, promoted better nodulation and effectiveness on biological N fixation. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

Vuill. (R. stolonifer (Ehrenb.:Fr.) Vuill.) and Botrytis cinerea Pers. Fr. (B. cinerea Pers. Fr.) are causal agents of important post-harvest diseases in strawberries. For their control, the essential oil (EO) extracted from the leaves of Eucalyptus staigeriana Muell. ex Bailey (E. staigeriana F. Muell. ex Bailey) and Eucalyptus urograndis W. Hill ex Maiden (E. urograndis W. Hill ex Maiden) can be a good alternative to the synthetic fungicides. Thus, the antifungal activity of the EOs from E. staigeriana F. Muell. ex Bailey and from E. urograndis W. Hill ex Maiden was evaluated in vitro on the fungi B. cinerea Pers. Fr. and R. stolonifer (Ehrenb.:Fr.) Vuill. The effects on pathogen morphology and the in vivo antifungal activity of the EO that presented the highest activity in vitro, associated with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), were also verified. The chemical composition of the essential oils evaluated was determined. The EO from E. staigeriana F. Muell. ex Bailey was the most efficient in the in vitro assays on the two fungi. This EO, whose major compound is limonene, caused dehydration and rupture of the fungal hyphae, suggesting its action is on the cell wall and membrane. The incorporation of this EO to CMC in the curative way reduced the severity of soft rot, caused by R. stolonifer (Ehrenb.:Fr.) Vuill.; nevertheless, it did not present an effect on the inhibition of B. cinerea Pers. Fr. These results suggest that E. staigeriana F. Muell. ex Bailey EO, associated to CMC coating, can be an alternative to the use of synthetic fungicides for the control of R. stolonifer (Ehrenb.:Fr.) Vuill., mainly. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We generated a draft genome of Thalictrum thalictroides, a representative of a clade with ancestral floral traits (diploid, hermaphrodite, and insect pollinated) and a model for functional studies. Floral transcriptomes of T. thalictroides and of wind-pollinated, andromonoecious T. hernandezii are presented as a resource to facilitate candidate gene discovery in flowers with different sexual and pollination systems. Methods: A draft genome of T. thalictroides and two floral transcriptomes of T. thalictroides and T. hernandezii were obtained from HiSeq 2000 Illumina sequencing and de novo assembly. Results: The T. thalictroides de novo draft genome assembly consisted of 44,860 contigs (N50 = 12,761 bp, 243 Mbp total length) and contained 84.5% conserved embryophyte single-copy genes. Floral transcriptomes contained representatives of most eukaryotic core genes, and most of their genes formed orthogroups. Discussion: To validate the utility of these resources, potential candidate genes were identified for the different floral morphologies using stepwise data set comparisons. Single-copy gene analysis and simple sequence repeat markers were also generated as a resource for population-level and phylogenetic studies. © 2021 Arias et al.

Forest-to-pasture conversion has been associated with increases in soil methane (CH4) emission. To better understand the drivers of this change, we measured soil CH4 flux, environmental conditions, and belowground microbial community structure across primary forests, cattle pastures, and secondary forests in two Amazonian regions. We show that pasture soils emit high levels of CH4 (mean: 3454.6 ± 9482.3 μg CH4 m−2 d−1), consistent with previous reports, while forest soils on average emit CH4 at modest rates (mean: 9.8 ± 120.5 μg CH4 m−2 d−1), but often act as CH4 sinks. We report that secondary forest soils tend to consume CH4 (mean: −10.2 ± 35.7 μg CH4 m−2 d−1), demonstrating that pasture CH4 emissions can be reversed. We apply a novel computational approach to identify microbial community attributes associated with flux independent of soil chemistry. While this revealed taxa known to produce or consume CH4 directly (i.e. methanogens and methanotrophs, respectively), the vast majority of identified taxa are not known to cycle CH4. Each land use type had a unique subset of taxa associated with CH4 flux, suggesting that land use change alters CH4 cycling through shifts in microbial community composition. Taken together, we show that microbial composition is crucial for understanding the observed CH4 dynamics and that microorganisms provide explanatory power that cannot be captured by environmental variables. © 2020 The Authors	Article	Scopus

As the interactions of the glyphosate and Fertiactyl® in tank mix on the plant behavior are not yet known, the objective was to evaluate the absorption and translocation of 14C-glyphosate, applied isolated and mixed in tank with Fertiactyl®, in young eucalyptus plants (clone I-144, Eucalyptus urophylla x E. grandis). The addition of Fertiactyl® to the mixture of 14C-glyphosate reduced the absorption by 94.3% in relation to the total absorbed at the end of the evaluation compared to plants treated only with 14C-glyphosate, i.e., Fertiactyl® protected the eucalyptus plants of the glyphosate intoxication by drift. The translocation rates from the treated leaves to the rest of the shoots and roots were low (<2% of the total recovered) in both treatments, suggest that restricted translocation is a mechanism of natural tolerance to glyphosate in plants of clone I-144. It is concluded that Fertiactyl®, mixed in the solution with glyphosate, protects young eucalyptus plants against glyphosate drift by reducing the amount of herbicide absorbed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Our objectives were to measure the tolerance of Canavalia ensiformes (L.) DC., Stilizobium aterrimum L., Raphanus sativus L., Crotalaria spectabilis Röth, Lupinus albus L., and Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. To the herbicides diuron, hexazinone, and sulfometuron-methyl to assess the capacity of these species to extract and accumulate the herbicides in their tissues. Before sowing the green manure species, the soils were individually contaminated with the three 14C-radiolabeled herbicides. 14C-diuron and 14C-sulfometuron-methyl showed higher values remaining in the soil (>90%) for all species of green manure compared to hexazinone (<80%). The green manure species analyzed showed greater potential to remedy soils contaminated with hexazinone than the other herbicides. C. ensiformes showed high phytoextraction of hexazinone when compared to the other species, removing 11.2% of the pollutant from the soil, followed by L. albus (8.6%), S. aterrimum (7.3%), R. sativus (4.8%), C. spectabilis (2.5%), and P. glaucum (1.1%). The results indicate that the phytoextraction of diuron, hexazinone and sulfometuron-methyl is dependent on the species of green manure and can be an important tool for the decontamination of areas polluted by these herbicides. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Modeling of the involved macropore flow is complex due to large number of required parameters. One way to deal with this difficulty is the precise evaluation of the soil hydraulic conductivity function using robust pedotransfer functions for the near-saturated part. Aiming to develop pedotransfer functions to estimate saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities [Ks and K(h)] as well as water contents at specific pressure heads, we used Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), a non-parametric machine learning model, to obtain van Genuchten (1980) retention and conductivity parameters for Danish soils based on soil texture and organic matter. We defined K10 as K(h) at − 10 cm pressure head. The difference between the logarithm of Ks and K10 [log(Ks) − log(K10)] was denominated log(Kjump) and was assumed to convey the potential degree of macropore flow considering only soil hydraulic properties. Macropore flow in Denmark was evaluated through the developed PTFs for log(Ks) and log(K10) with an average RMSE of 0.635 and 0.594 (for K in cm d−1) under a confidence interval obtained by bootstrapping. Dynamics of pressure head in an initially saturated soil column with a zero-flux top boundary condition and a 2 m deep groundwater level were simulated using the Hydrus-1D model. The result of this modeling showed that soils in the eastern part of Denmark had a higher likelihood to experience macropore flow. Finally, using the spatial distribution of meteorological data, a macropore flow map of Denmark was produced. Precipitation was a dominating factor on macropore flow in sandy clay loam and sandy loam soils when compared to sandy and loamy sand soils. Finally, maps of relative risk classes of macropore flow qualitatively differentiated land areas in Denmark for vulnerability of nutrient loss and groundwater contamination. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The use of genetically modified plants is an alternative to control this vector. Conversely, technology based on RNA interference (RNAi) for silencing specific genes of a target insect could be attempted. This work evaluated the knockdown effect of the target genes calreticulin (DcCRT), laccase (DcLAC), and Snf7 (DcSnf7) by RNAi through feeding D. citri in Murraya paniculata leaves after the uptake of an aqueous solution with dsRNA homologous to each vector target gene. Confocal microscopy revealed the uptake of the fluorescent-labeled dsRNA by detached leaves and the symplastic movement, allowing the ingestion by the feeding insect. A reduction in the survival rate was observed only 144 h after the beginning of feeding with dsRNA targeting DcSnf7; however, no reduction in transcript accumulation. The knockdown of the DcCRT and DcLAC genes was detected only 12 and 96 h after insect feeding, respectively. Additionally, a reduction in amino acid excretion from insects fed with dsRNA targets to DcCRT and DcLAC was observed 120 h after the beginning of feeding. However, the effects of the dsRNAs tested here appear to be minimal, both at the transcriptional and phenotype levels. For most concentrations and time points, no effects were observed. Therefore, the knockdown of genes DcCRT, DcLAC, and DcSnf7 do not appear to have the potential to control of D. citri through RNAi-mediated gene silencing. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Predicting tropical forest function requires understanding the relative contributions of two mechanisms of high-temperature photosynthetic declines: stomatal limitation (H1), an indirect response due to temperature-associated changes in atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD)7, and biochemical restrictions (H2), a direct temperature response8,9. Their relative control predicts different outcomes—H1 is expected to diminish with stomatal responses to future co-occurring elevated atmospheric [CO2], whereas H2 portends declining photosynthesis with increasing temperatures. Distinguishing the two mechanisms at high temperatures is therefore critical, but difficult because VPD is highly correlated with temperature in natural settings. We used a forest mesocosm to quantify the sensitivity of tropical gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) to future temperature regimes while constraining VPD by controlling humidity. We then analytically decoupled temperature and VPD effects under current climate with flux-tower-derived GEP trends in situ from four tropical forest sites. Both approaches showed consistent, negative sensitivity of GEP to VPD but little direct response to temperature. Importantly, in the mesocosm at low VPD, GEP persisted up to 38 °C, a temperature exceeding projections for tropical forests in 2100 (ref. 10). If elevated [CO2] mitigates VPD-induced stomatal limitation through enhanced water-use efficiency as hypothesized9,11, tropical forest photosynthesis may have a margin of resilience to future warming. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

The office in Latin America was proposed in the context of broad global and local environmental changes and the agricultural need for nutrient addition, looking into processes that would horizontally permeate between these two important elements for human survival and for the Earth's system. However, the lack of information on the nitrogen cycle in Latin America is a serious impediment to evaluate properly how human activity is altering nitrogen pools and turnover at regional and global scales. Empirical measurements of N deposition and other N cycle processes are extremely scarce in Latin America, and data feeding to global and regional circulation models lack spatial distribution information in this region. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

We also evaluated whether the community's dynamic was reestablished with secondary forest growth. In general, the microbial community structure was influenced by changes in soil chemical properties. Aluminum and nitrate significantly correlated to community structure and with 12 out of 21 microbial phyla. The N-related microbial groups and their potential functions were also affected by land-use change, with pasture being clearly different from primary and secondary forest systems. The microbial community analysis demonstrated that forest-to-pasture conversion increased the abundance of different microbial groups related to nitrogen fixation, including Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Firmicutes. In contrast, after pasture abandonment and with the secondary forest regeneration, there was an increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria taxa and denitrification genes. Our multi-analytical approach indicated that the secondary forest presented some signs of resilience, suggesting that the N-related microbial groups and their potential functions can be recovered over time with implications for future ecological restoration programs. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

(Fabaceae), causing significant yield losses in important soybean-producing regions. The use of soybean varieties resistant to lepidopteran larvae is a major approach in soybean integrated pest management. However, standardization and optimization of bioassays that are used to screen genotypes for insect resistance are essential for high-throughput phenotyping. Methodologies for screening were assessed to determine the most effective method for discriminating levels of antixenosis to H. virescens in soybean plants. Feeding and oviposition preference assays were performed to determine optimal densities of larvae and adults, and optimal plant structures and growth stages for conducting assays. In addition, trichome densities, and fiber and lignin contents were quantified in plant structures of soybean cultivars differing in resistance. Resistance levels of cultivars were best differentiated using nine neonate larvae and two 6-day-old larvae, and by using young leaves of plants at the vegetative stage. This was likely due to the more pronounced differences in lignin and fiber contents in young leaves of vegetative-stage plants. Density of adult pairs, plant structure, and growth stage did not affect ability to distinguish differences in oviposition preference by H. virescens. Higher numbers of eggs were found on the leaves, which were the plant structures that exhibited the lowest trichome densities. The protocol developed in this work will benefit future evaluations of soybean genotypes for antixenosis against H. virescens. © 2020 The Netherlands Entomological Society	Article	Scopus

Sedimentary features, pollen, and isotopes data from six sediment cores, as well as 14C datings, indicated a marine transgression during the Holocene, and it contributed to the expansion of tidal flats occupied by saltmarshes. Environmental conditions suitable for mangroves development occurred on the study site during the Holocene, but, according to 210Pb and 14C dating, the establishment of mangroves mainly represented by Laguncularia trees only began between ~1957 and ~1986 (AD) on the studied tidal flats. Spatial-temporal analysis, based on satellite and drone images, revealed a mangrove expansion of ~10 ha in the study area between 2003 (96.1 ha) and 2019 (106.1 ha). Nowadays, in the study area, saltmarshes, mainly characterized by Spartina and Acrostichum, are sharing tidal flats with mangroves, represented by Laguncularia (≤5 m tall) and Avicennia (≤11 m tall). Probably, the absence of mangroves during the Holocene, followed by their establishment and expansion during the Anthropocene in the subtropical zone, is associated with a migration of the austral mangrove limit into the temperate zone, caused by the gradual increase in winter temperatures. This process may be related to a poleward mangrove migration since the late Holocene, caused by a natural Holocene global warming. However, the industrial-era warming must have intensified the mangrove expansion into temperate zones. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

This study aimed to determine whether sugarcane straw removal from the field benefits the N-fertilizer recovery by plant (NRP), and if legume cultivation will further improve NRP. Half of a field was planted with sunn hemp (Crotalaria spectabilis) and half was left fallow. In the second ratoon, treatments with 0, 50, and 100% of sugarcane straw maintenance levels were installed, receiving 120 kg ha−1 N over straw. A microplot of ammonium nitrate labeled with 1.99% atoms 15N was included. NRP was quantified at 92, 164, and 264 days after fertilization (DAF). At harvest (264 DAF), soil samples and straw (<4 mm and >4 mm fractions) were collected to determine N-fertilizer recovery in the soil (NRS) and in the straw (NRSt). Maintaining 50 and 100% of straw improved NRP over the sugarcane cycle. NRP was not improved by crop rotation cultivation and NRS averaged 50% in the entire soil profile. NRSt at harvest averaged 1–3% in the 50% and 100% straw levels. Contrary to the current view, N-fertilizer immobilization in the straw was negligible and keeping straw could improve NRP. The findings indicate that increasing N rates in green cane trash blanket system to compensate for the N-fertilizer immobilization is not necessary, and that straw removal for bioenergy production will change the short-term demand for N-fertilizer. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

State-of-the-art molecular approaches such as those based on single-amplified genomes (SAGs) and metagenome assembled-genomes (MAGs) are now improving our capacity for disentailing soil microbial-mediated processes. Here, we analysed publicly available datasets of soil microbial genomes and MAG's reconstructed from the Amazon's tropical soil (primary forest and pasture) and active layer of permafrost, aiming to evaluate their genome size. Our results suggest that the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR)/Patescibacteria phyla have genomes with an average size fourfold smaller than the mean identified in the RefSoil database, which lacks any representative of this phylum. Also, by analysing the potential metabolism of 888 soil microbial genomes, we show that CPR/Patescibacteria representatives share similar functional profiles, but different from other microbial phyla and are frequently neglected in the soil microbial surveys. Finally, we argue that the use of MAGs may be a better choice over SAGs to expand the soil microbial databases, like RefSoil. © 2020 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd	Article	Scopus

To counteract the damaging effects of UVR, cyanobacteria developed adaptive strategies such as the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of UVR on the metabolomic profiles of potentially toxic cyanobacteria. Twelve strains were irradiated with ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B radiation and parabolic aluminized reflector lamps for 3 days, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to assess changes in metabolomic profiles. Matrices were used to generate principal component analysis biplots, and molecular networks were obtained using the Global Natural Products platform. Most strains showed significant changes in their metabolomic profiles after UVR exposure. On average, 7% of MS features were shown to be exclusive to metabolomic profiles before UVR exposure, while 9% were unique to metabolomic profiles after UVR exposure. The identified compounds included aeruginosins, spumigins, cyanopeptolins, microginins, namalides, pseudospumigins, anabaenopeptins, mycosporine-like amino acids, nodularins and microcystins. Data showed that cyanobacteria display broad metabolic plasticity upon UVR exposure, including the synthesis and differential expression of a variety of secondary metabolites. This could result in a competitive advantage, supporting cyanobacterial blooms under various UVR light exposures.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of FEMS.

However, it is unclear the effect of these herbicides on soil microbial communities. In this study, we assessed the responses of bacterial community to the application of imazethapyr and flumyzin in soil. Soil samples were incubated with the application of the herbicides imazethapyr, flumyzin, and their mixture, and analyzed at 0, 15, 30, and 60 days. The abundance of specific microbial phyla changed as a response of the herbicide application with a significant decrease of Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Elusimicrobia, and Planctomycetes, and an increase of Gemmatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. The principal component analysis clustered the samples according to the time of incubation and the microbial diversity increased on the 15th day with a trend to decrease at 30 and 60 days. The evaluation of potential functions has shown the core functions represented by chemoheterotrophy (35.1%), followed by aerobic chemoheterotrophy (32.8%), nitrification (6.2%), ammonia oxidation (6.2%), and aromatic compound degradation (4.4%). Our data showed an increase of microbial groups that have the potential to metabolize the chemical compounds, such as the genera Bryobacter, Gaiella, and Flavobacterium, which increased significantly in abundance and can be explored for future biotechnological use. Finally, this study shows that the application of the herbicides in soil affects the microbial profile with the potential to affect functions mediated by microbial communities, and this effect is related to groups with the potential to degrade the compound. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS	Article	Scopus

Through reports of animal intoxication by cyanobacteria cells that produce GNT, this study aimed to investigate the bio-accessibility of GNT in simulated solutions of the gastrointestinal content in order to understand the process of toxicosis promoted by GNT in vivo. Dissolution tests were conducted with a mixture of Sphaerospermopsis torques-reginae (Cyanobacteria; Nostocales) cultures (30%) and gastrointestinal solutions with and without proteolytic enzymes (70%) at a temperature of 37◦ C and rotation at 100 rpm for 2 h. The identification of GNT was performed by LC-QqQ-MS/MS through the transitions [M + H]+ m/z 253 > 58 and [M + H]+ m/z 253 > 159, which showed high concentrations of GNT in simulated gastric fluid solutions (p-value <0.001) in comparison to simulated solutions of intestinal content. The gastric solution with pepsin promoted the stability of GNT (p-value < 0.05) compared to the simulated solution of gastric fluid at the same pH without the enzyme. However, the results showed that GNT is also available in intestinal fluids for a period of 2 h, and solutions containing the pancreatin enzyme influenced the bio-accessibility of the toxin more compared to the intestinal medium without enzyme (p-value < 0.05). Therefore, the bio-accessibility of the toxin must be considered both in the stomach and in the intestine, and may help in the diagnosis and prediction of exposure and risk in vivo through the oral ingestion of GNT-producing cyanobacteria cells. © 2020 by the authors.

We evaluated GA maintaining its assumption of saturated flow but calibrating the effective matric suction at the wetting front (hf) by damping the initial matric suction (hi). The proposition was evaluated comparing cumulative infiltration simulated by GA to that simulated by Hydrus-1D for five soils from three texture classes, three initial matric suctions, and five 24-h water supply regimes. For each case, GA was run with a decreasing series of 20 values of hf from the initial matric suction (10, 100, or 1000 cm) to values near 1 cm. To minimize the relative error (RE) between cumulative infiltration simulated by GA and Hydrus-1D for the 24-h period we found the required damping of hf to be dependent on soil type, water supply regime and initial matric suction, the latter being the most important factor. The calibration of hf was efficient to approach GA predictions to numerical Hydrus-1D simulations, even for cases with alternating ponding and non-ponding conditions. Results suggest a large reduction of wetting front matric suction hf may be necessary to approach cumulative infiltration predicted by GA to corresponding Hydrus-1D predictions, especially during rainfall events that do not imply in continuous ponding. Taking hf somewhere between 1 and 3 cm, values of RE of cumulative infiltration during the first 24 h were below 10% for all cases, independent of soil type, rainfall characteristics or initial water content. © 2020 The Authors.

Here we investigate the environmental changes in the karst region of Chapada do Apodi - Northeastern Brazil (NEB), using a multi-proxy approach including carbon (δ13C), oxygen (δ18O) and strontium (87Sr/86Sr) isotopic analyses on speleothems from different caves, carbonate bedrock, and clastic cave deposits. This approach reveals that the balance between soil formation and erosion and their alternating impact on vegetation and precipitation changes occurred in response to variations in the position and intensity of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the region. The high δ13C and δ18O and low 87Sr/86Sr values at 4,200 yrs BP indicate a massive episode of soil erosion, resulting in the exposure of carbonate bedrocks over a large area of the karst terrain. This event marks the beginning of the Meghalayan chronozone, characterized as the aridification of this region, decline in soil production, drying out of underground drainages, and increased dominance of dry-adapted flora species, characteristic of a more open vegetation (caatinga). We investigated if the Holocene climatic changes affected human occupation in the NEB and found that the overall demographic course is virtually identical to the well-established curve characterized by population deflation during Middle Holocene. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

According to the validation method, water samples from six different locations in the Piracicaba River were collected monthly from February 2011 to January 2012 and injected into a liquid chromatographer/dual mass spectrometer without the need for sample extraction. The method was validated and shown to be precise and accurate; limits of detection and quantification were 0.07 and 0.10 µg L−1 for atrazine and 0.09 and 0.14 µg L−1 for ametrine. During the sampling period, concentrations of atrazine ranged from 0.11 to 1.92 µg L−1 and ametrine from 0.25 to 1.44 µg L−1. After analysis of the herbicides, Danio rerio were exposed a range of concentrations found in the river water to check the induction of micronuclei and nuclear abnormalities (NAs) in erythrocytes. Concentrations of atrazine and ametrine >1.0 and 1.5 µg L−1, respectively, induced MN formation in D. rerio. Ametrine was shown to be more genotoxic to D. rerio because a greater incidence of NAs was observed compared with atrazine. Therefore, environmentally relevant concentrations of atrazine and ametrine found in the Piracicaba River are dangerous to the aquatic biota. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York	Article	Scopus

Biochar is known to enhance soil quality but can also have undesired effects such as altering the bioavailability and behavior of herbicides. Microbial communities can degrade herbicides such as sulfometuron-methyl in soils; however, they are known to be affected by BC. Therefore, it is important to understand the tripartite interaction between these factors. This research aimed to evaluate the sorption-desorption and biodegradation of sulfometuron-methyl in Amazonian soils amended with BC, and to assess the effects of the interactions between BC and sulfometuron-methyl on soil bacterial communities. Soil samples were collected from field plots amended with BC at three doses (0, 40 and 80 t ha−1) applied ten years ago. The herbicide sorption and desorption were evaluated using a batch equilibrium method. Mineralization and biodegradation studies were conducted in microcosms incubated with 14C-sulfometuron-methyl for 80 days. Systematic soil sampling, followed by DNA extraction, quantification (qPCR) and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were performed. The presence of BC increased the sorption of the herbicide to the soil by 11% (BC40) and 16% (BC80) compared to unamended soil. The presence of BC also affected the degradation of 14C-sulfometuron-methyl, reducing the mineralization rate and increasing the degradation half-life times (DT50) from 36.67 days in unamended soil to 52.11 and 55.45 days in BC40 and BC80 soils, respectively. The herbicide application altered the bacterial communities, affecting abundance and richness, and changing the taxonomic diversity (i.e., some taxa were promoted and other inhibited). A tripartite interaction was found between BC, the herbicide and soil bacterial communities, suggesting that it is important to consider the environmental impact of soil applied herbicides in biochar amended soils. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

For the widespread and highly polyphagous Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), the fall-armyworm (FAW), DIMBOA acts as a feeding stimulant and improves larval growth at low concentrations. The FAW present two host plant-related strains, corn and rice strains, related to host preference on corn and other Graminae or rice. Based on both host preference and strain divergence of the FAW on corn, a cereal containing DIMBOA, and rice, lacking this compound, we question if corn and rice strains larvae respond equally toward DIMBOA. We evaluated differential expression in the transcriptome of both midgut and fat body larval tissues of the two strains reared on either DIMBOA-enriched artificial diet or control diet and inferred Bayesian networks. RESULTS: We found differences in performance between corn and rice strain larvae reared on DIMBOA, as well as several differentially regulated contigs annotated as esterases, peptidases, transferases and reductases, all of them known for being related to responses of lepidopterans and other insects to DIMBOA. We also found a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase very similar to others found in many lepidopterans occupying a central hub within a transferase Bayesian network, suggesting that it is essential to an effective response to DIMBOA in FAW. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that there is an intrinsic cost for FAW rice strain larvae to metabolize corn-originated hydroxamic acids, which could have resulted in the partial host-associated genetic isolation found at FAW field populations. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry	Article	Scopus

These alterations, combined with regional climate changes, have the potential to influence the hydrologic cycle at small to large scales. We evaluated a 40-year time series (1976 to 2015) of rainfall and water yield and related them to land use changes in the Upper Xingu River Basin (UX). We acquired data from six rainfall stations and four river gauges and mapped land use changes. Mann-Kendall trend analysis and Pettitt’s change point detection were employed to describe annual and seasonal changes in the time series. Monthly water yield from the Xingu River was used to derive annual, seasonal, and monthly water yield, as well as the runoff coefficient. The largest changes in land use occurred during the last two decades and approximately 60,900 km2 in the Upper Xingu Basin were deforested between 1985 and 2015. Rainfall in the Xingu Basin decreased by about 245 mm over the period but there was no trend in water yield. The number of rainy days and intensity of events also decreased, but the length of the rainy season and seasonal and annual water yield did not change. Although watershed deforestation has increased water yield in other Amazon rivers, the reduction in rainfall in the Upper Xingu Basin was high enough to mask this effect. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Although much research has investigated farm size and economic output, the synergies and trade-offs across various agricultural and socioeconomic variables are unclear. This study applies a GIS-based approach to official Brazilian census data (Agricultural Censuses of 1995, 2006, and 2017) and surveys at the municipality level to (i) evaluate changes in the average soybean farm size across the country and (ii) compare agricultural and socioeconomic outcomes (i.e., soybean yield, agricultural production value, crop production diversity, and rural labor employment) relative to the average soybean farm size. Statistical tests (e.g., Kruskal–Wallis tests and Spearman’s correlation) were used to analyze variable outcomes in different classes of farm sizes and respective Agricultural Censuses. We found that agricultural and socioeconomic outcomes are spatially correlated with soybean farm size class. Therefore, based on the concepts of trade-offs and synergies, we show that municipalities with large soybean farm sizes had larger trade-offs (e.g., larger farm size was associated with lower crop diversity), while small and medium ones manifest greater synergies. These patterns are particularly strong for analysis using the Agricultural Census of 2017. Trade-off/synergy analysis across space and time is key for supporting long-term strategies aiming at alleviating unemployment and providing sustainable food production, essential to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the effects of applying lime and gypsum alone or in combination on the microbial population and N cycle in intercropped no-till tropical systems are largely unknown. Here, we determined the lasting effects of applying lime and gypsum individually or in combination on soil chemical properties, N uptake by intercropped plants, maize yield, archaeal and bacterial abundances, and N cycle genes in the maize and ruzigrass rhizospheres in a long-term field experiment in tropical soil with a no-till maize and forage ruzigrass intercropping system. Our results showed that the application of lime or lime + gypsum increased soil fertility and the gene abundances of microorganisms responsible for biological nitrogen fixation and reduced gene abundances of nitrification and denitrification in the soil and rhizosphere of ruzigrass and maize. The accompanying increases in Ca2+ and Mg2+ availability, reduced Al3+ levels, and balance of micronutrient availability, mainly Mn, in the soil strongly influenced the responses of N cycle genes and enhanced plant N-acquisition and maize yield. © 2020 The Authors	Article	Scopus

The oldest rock art and artifacts in Caatinga are dated from 10,000 BP. Besides that, there is no register of ancient activities in soils in Caatinga. Four pedons were taken, described and classified in sites with a high number of artifacts littering the surface and/or rock art. Five more pedons were described to represent soil without anthropic influence. Soils are shallow and transition between horizons was predominantly clear or abrupt. Anthrosols in Caatinga have value and chroma similar to the anthropic horizons described in Amazonian dark earths. The pedons are strongly acid to slightly alkaline and predominantly have base saturation above 50% in all horizons. Anthrosols in Caatinga have up to 6 and 544 times, respectively, more soil organic carbon and phosphorus compared to adjacent soils without anthropic influence. Besides illite and kaolinite, apatite and calcite compose the clay and silt fractions and confirm the human influence in soil formation. Radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dating indicate that Anthrosols in Caatinga are contemporaneous to the majority of Amazonian dark earths. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

However, they can present impacts on soil properties, such as biological properties. In this study, we evaluated the responses of soil microbial biomass and enzymes activity to the application of the herbicides imazethapyr and flumioxazin and their mixture in an experiment under laboratory conditions, using soils with a different history of use. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) decreased, while microbial biomass N (MBN) was not affected after the application of the herbicides as compared to the control. Soil respiration, respiratory quotient, and dehydrogenase (DHA) activity increased significantly after the application of the herbicides compared to the control. The hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) was not significantly different between the control and the herbicide treatments. The principal response curve showed the largest initial effects for the flumioxazin, followed by imazethapyr and their mixture. Flumioxazin had a different influence on soil respiration and respiratory quotient than imazethapyr and their mixture.

Thus, the present study evaluated yield, chemical composition and in vitro gas production of silages produced with intercropped palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha. (A.Rich.) R.D.Webster), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan cv. Super N) and corn (Zea mays. L.). Forage was harvested and placed inside micro-silos, which were opened after 100 days and samples were collected for chemical composition and in vitro gas production analyses. Intercropped silage had higher crude protein, acid detergent fiber, and lignin content than corn silage. Moreover, intercropped silage decreased total gas and methane production. Therefore, intercropped silage showed potential to increase conserved feed nutritional quality and reduce methane emissions in livestock production systems. © 2020 by the authors.	Article	Scopus

However, little is known concerning the bacterial molecular basis for the improvement of plant fitness. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop techniques that can contribute to the elucidation of the genetic basis for the mechanisms involved in beneficial bacterium–plant interactions. In this context, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 is a powerful tool based on programmable molecular scissors that perform precise incisions in any DNA sequence. CRISPR-Cas9 can alter gene sequences and constitutes a cutting-edge tool to elucidate the role and function of bacterial genes associated with the benefits of plant interactions. The method described here uses a feasible CRISPR-Cas9 system in a double plasmid, one plasmid harboring the Cas9 endonuclease and the other the sgRNA, to promote gene knockout/editing in the Bacillus genus. This approach favors high efficiency in generating mutants for one or more genes in continuous or multiplex editing. Additionally, due to its universality, it can be applied to genera other than Bacillus. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	Book chapter	Scopus

Abstract: Gossypium hirsutum is the most important cotton species that is cultivated worldwide. Although cotton reproductive development is important for fiber production, since fiber is formed on the epidermis of mature ovules, cotton floral development remains poorly understood. Therefore, this work aims to characterize the cotton floral morphoanatomy by performing a detailed description of anther and ovule developmental programs and identifying stage-specific floral marker genes in G. hirsutum. Using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, we analyzed anther and ovule development during 11 stages of flower development. To better characterize the ovule development in cotton, we performed histochemical analyses to evaluate the accumulation of phenolic compounds, pectin, and sugar in ovule tissues. After identification of major hallmarks of floral development, three key stages were established in G. hirsutum floral development: in stage 1 (early—EF), sepal, petal, and stamen primordia were observed; in stage 2 (intermediate—IF), primordial ovules and anthers are present, and the differentiating archesporial cells were observed, marking the beginning of microsporogenesis; and in stage 6 (late—LF), flower buds presented initial anther tapetum degeneration and microspore were released from the tetrad, and nucellus and both inner and outer integuments are developing. We used transcriptome data of cotton EF, IF and LF stages to identify floral marker genes and evaluated their expression by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Twelve marker genes were preferentially expressed in a stage-specific manner, including the putative homologs for AtLEAFY, AtAPETALA 3, AtAGAMOUS-LIKE 19 and AtMALE STERILITY 1, which are crucial for several aspects of reproductive development, such as flower organogenesis and anther and petal development. We also evaluated the expression profile of B-class MADS-box genes in G. hirsutum floral transcriptome (EF, IF, and LF). In addition, we performed a comparative analysis of developmental programs between Arabidopsis thaliana and G. hirsutum that considered major morphoanatomical and molecular processes of flower, anther, and ovule development. Our findings provide the first detailed analysis of cotton flower development. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	Article	Scopus

The objective of this research was to evaluate the use of green manure plants to remediate soils treated with quinclorac and tebuthiuron. Soils were separately treated with 14C-quinclorac and 14C-tebuthiuron at 266.4 and 132 g ha−1, respectively. After 21 days, four green manure plants, namely Crotalaria spectabilis, Canavalia ensiformis, Stizolobium aterrimum, and Lupinus albus, were separately sown in the treated soils. Overall, all four species absorbed more 14C-tebuthiuron [C. ensiformes (22.49%), S. aterrimum (16.71%), L. albus (15%), and C. spectabilis (4.48%)] than 14C-quinclorac [C. ensiformis (13.44%), L. albus (10.02%), S. aterrimum (6.2%), and C. spectabilis (1.75%)]. Quinclorac translocation in all four plants was greater in young leaves compared to old leaves, cotyledons, or roots, and 14C-tebuthiuron translocation in all four plant species was greater in old leaves and cotyledons compared to young leaves or roots. Regardless of the differences in translocation between the two herbicides, the four green manure plants are capable to remediate soils that have been treated with quinclorac and tebuthiuron. However, C. ensiformis is more efficient for the remediation of tebuthiuron-treated soil compared to the other plants. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	Article	Scopus

With increasing the profile depth, the C[sbnd]H FTIR absorption decreased accompanied by a relative increase in C[dbnd]O FTIR absorption. A number of significant correlations were found between the experimental variables measured. In particular, the positive correlation between soil organic carbon (SOC) (1.43 to 31.13 g kg−1) and intensity of aromatic structural C[dbnd]C peak at 1620 cm−1 downward the soil profile suggested the existence of higher amounts of more stable organic compounds with depth. The negative correlation between the intensity of aliphatic structures peaks from 3000 to 2800 cm−1 and the clay minerals content indicated an increasing soil wettability with depth. The relative affinity of organic matter to mineral surfaces changed as a function of the mineral type distribution along the soil profile. As well, the chemical composition of organic matter and the type of phase fractions influenced whole soil wettability based on the SOC/clay relation to CA. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Marandu subjected to different light availabilities. Six light conditions were studied: application followed by 24, 48 or 72 h of dark, 72 h of light, 24 h of dark + 48 h of light and daytime in different evaluation times: 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after application of 14C-glyphosate (1.67 kBq/plant). The herbicide absorption was higher in plants with less light availability at 72 HAA (48 and 21% for 72 h of darkness and 72 h of light, respectively); however, there was a greater translocation of 14C-glyphosate to roots in the high availability of light (23 and 5% for 72 h of light and 72 h of dark, respectively). Thus, in U. brizantha plants, under conditions of greater light availability, 14C-glyphosate was less absorbed, but the product was more translocated. It is recommended that farmers to apply glyphosate at daytime since the light positively favored translocation, which is essential to the herbicidal activity. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

The combined use of macro- and microscopic techniques can provide information on P distribution and reactivity in soils, which is an important key to determine its loss potential into the environment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of rates of P on solid-state P speciation in an Oxisol under no-till (NT) for 26 years in Brazil. Soil samples were collected from experimental plots that received 0 to 50 kg ha−1P annually. X-ray Fluorescence microanalysis (µ-XRF), X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES), and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies were used along with soil mineralogical and conventional chemical analyses. Phosphorus availability increased with the applied P rates. Based on the µ-XRF analysis, high Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were obtained for P vs Al, Si and Fe contents (r = 0.97, 0.81 and 0.84, respectively, with P < 0.0001); and partial correlation showed co-localized effects mainly for Al and Si. The Fe-EXAFS results hinted to the presence of non-crystalline iron (Fe) minerals being favored in the cultivated soils, likely as a consequence of the higher rates of P applied and utilization by the crops. P-XANES data revealed that after the fertilization, the proportion of P sorbed to goethite did not vary, but the proportion of P sorbed to hematite decreased, while P sorbed to kaolinite increased. The long-term continuous application of P fertilizers beyond plant uptake capacity favored P build-up in soils, resulting not only in poor P use efficiency but also in exacerbated risk of P loss to the environment. © 2020 The Authors	Article	Scopus

SERK expression marks somatic embryogenesis, sexual MMC, and sexual and apomictic PMC. BbrizSERK3 might have a regulatory role in reproductive development. Abstract: Somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase (SERK) consists of plasma membrane receptor genes that have been characterized in various species, associated with several aspects of plant development, including reproduction. SERK genes are involved in anther development and in early embryo development in sexual and asexual seed formation. To comprehend the complexity of the SERK genes and their function in Brachiaria reproduction, we performed a homology-based search in a genomic database of a sexual B. brizantha and identified sequences of three SERK genes, BbrizSERK1, BbrizSERK2, and BbrizSERK3. RNASeq data showed equivalent abundance of BbrizSERK1 and BbrizSERK2 transcripts in ovaries at early megasporogenesis of sexuals and apomicts, while BbrizSERK3 transcripts were more abundant in ovaries of sexuals than in apomicts. BbrizSERK3 results in three coding sequences due to alternative splicing, among them Variant 1 results in a protein with all the predicted domains of a SERK. BbrizSERK transcripts were detected in male reproductive tissues of both sexual and apomictic plants, suggesting a role in controlling anther development. BbrizSERK transcripts were detected early in ovule development, in the integuments, and in the megaspore mother cell of the sexual plant, but not in the cells that give rise to apomictic embryo sacs, suggesting a role in female reproductive development of sexuals. This paper provides evidences that SERK genes plays a role in the onset and establishment of somatic embryogenesis and in the reproductive development of B. brizantha and suggests a distinct role of BbrizSERK in apomixis initiation. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

G6-32 endophyte (isolated from the medicinal plant Sapindus saponaria L.) was investigated. The antioxidant potential was confirmed by the DPPH (22.5%) and ABTS (62.7%) assays, and the total phenolic compound content was 40 µg gallic acid equivalents/mg. The extract E-G6-32 displayed good inhibitory activity toward butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE; IC50 = 110 ± 0.05 µg mL−1). The extract E-G6-32 was subjected to spectroscopic and mass spectrometry analyses. Comparison with the literature data confirmed that (-)-asperpentyn (1) was a major component. Asperpentyn belongs to the epoxyquinone family, which has attractive structural complexity, diverse functional groups, and a broad range of biological activities, including specific enzyme inhibitory activity. Our results suggest that Curvularia sp. G6-32 is a promising source of bioactive secondary metabolites and contains (-)-asperpentyn, which has potential pharmaceutical interest.

Herein, we verify the use of internal standardization as a strategy for compensating for this matrix effect during As, Cd, and Pb determination in mineral fertilizers by SVDV ICP OES. Bismuth, Ir, Sc, and Y were chosen as internal standards (IS) and their ionic and atomic emission lines were carefully taken into account. The results indicated that the EIEs presence caused signal changes and internal standardization may be a suitable alternative to minimize this interference. By analyzing a certified reference material (CRM NIST 695) the best recoveries (from 94 to 106%) were achieved by applying internal standardization for all analytes. Concerning the elements evaluated as internal standards, Y (360.1 nm) and Sc (424.7 nm) were more suitable for As while Ir (215.8 nm) and Bi (190.2 nm and 195.4 nm) were suitable for Cd. For Pb, Ir (215.8 nm) was the most appropriate internal standard. The limits of detection using ISs were 0.70, 0.03 and 1.00 mg kg-1 for As, Cd and Pb, respectively. The application of internal standardization is an effective strategy to overcome matrix interferences in fertilizer analysis by SVDV ICP OES. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Its quantification usually involves liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, which requires complex and costly instrumentation as well as time-consuming sample pretreatment, typically involving large solvent volumes. In this work, sequential injection chromatography was exploited to develop a fast, green, cost-effective, and highly sensitive procedure for fluorimetric determination of salicylic acid in natural waters. Analyte preconcentration directly on the chromatographic column (on-column preconcentration) was exploited to improve detectability, yielding an enrichment factor of 122 (1.75 mL of sample) and takes only 8.5 min per determination. A detection limit of 20 ng/L, a linear response range from 0.06 to 5.00 µg/L, coefficients of variation lower than 3.0% (n = 10), and recoveries within 86 and 114% were estimated. The procedure was applied for the analyses of freshwater samples and results agreed with those obtained by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at the 95% confidence level. The proposed procedure encompasses in-line concentration, isolation/separation, and detection, without the need for sample clean-up, thus minimizing the consumption of organic solvents and risk of analyte losse. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Due to the XRF non-destructive feature, this technique may allow time-resolved plant tissue analyses under in vivo conditions, and additionally, the combination with other non-destructive techniques. In this study, we employed handheld and benchtop XRF to evaluate the elemental distribution changes in living plant tissues exposed to X-rays, as well as real-time uptake kinetics of Zn(aq) and Mn(aq) in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) stem and leaves, for 48 hours, combined with transpiration rate assessment on leaves by an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA). We found higher Zn content than Mn in stems. The latter micronutrient, in turn, presented higher concentration in leaf veins. Besides, both micronutrients were more concentrated in the first trifolium (i.e., youngest leaf) of soybean plants. Moreover, the transpiration rate was more influenced by circadian cycles than Zn and Mn uptake. Thus, XRF represents a convenient tool for in vivo nutritional studies in plants, and it can be coupled successfully to other analytical techniques. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

However, little is known about the Zn dynamics in plant–soil system. In this work, we evaluated the effect of soil-applied Zn on the absorption, translocation, and compartmentalization of Zn in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) plants. The soil used in the greenhouse experiment was fertilized with zinc chloride (ZnCl2) at rates of 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 mg Zn kg−1. The source of Zn was labeled by 65Zn with specific activity of 185.5 kBq mg−1 Zn. The amount of Zn derived from fertilizer and its use in each plants compartment was determined by direct method in isotopic calculations. Rice and soybean plants presented low efficiency in the absorption from soil-applied Zn. The accumulated Zn in the panicle, pod, and grains was not modified, due to its low translocation in the plant. The Zn uptake in rice plants was from 1.34 to 4.60 mg pot−1 in shoots and just 0.81 to 1.43 mg pot−1 translocated to panicles. Soybean plants presented Zn uptake between 2.36 and 4.68 mg pot−1 in shoots, out of which 0.19 to 0.34 mg.pot−1 and 0.48 to 0.57 mg pot−1 translocated to grains and pods, respectively. The nutrient utilization from fertilizer was low, with mean values of 12 and 8.7% for rice and soybean plants, respectively. Soil-applied Zn showed low capacity for enriching rice panicle and soybean pod or grain probably due low Zn uptake and translocation. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	Article	Scopus

In China, they are also used as an active ingredient in formulae to treat cancer. The objective of the study was to perform a large-scale metabolite profiling analysis to identify bioactive compounds in Piper anisum. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by the DPPH assay and total phenolics were assessed by Folin–Ciocalteu’s method. Antimicrobial activity was assessed against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, whereas cytotoxicity was assessed against tumor cell lines MCF-7, HCT116, HepG2 and HL-60, and non-tumor cell line MRC-5. The multiplatform metabolite profiling approach encompassed NMR, GC–MS and LC–MS analyses. P. anisum root extract showed the greatest antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content, followed by the stem and leaf extracts. P. anisum extracts showed a highly selective antimicrobial profile, being specifically active against C. albicans (MIC of 500 μg mL−1). Additionally, the root extract (50 μg mL−1) showed the highest cell inhibition percentages against tumor cell lines MCF-7 (59.5%), HCT116 (49.2%), and HepG2 (61.0%). Forty-eight metabolites were annotated by GC–MS and 27 by LC–MS. These included alkaloids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, hydrocarbons, organic acids, phenolic compounds, and terpenes. Taken together, these results showed that P. anisum root extract is a promising source of bioactive compounds. © 2019, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.	Article	Scopus

This work identified inland and seaward mangrove migrations along the Jucuruçu River (Bahia, Northeastern Brazil), during the Holocene based on sedimentary features, palynological and geochemical (δ13C, δ15N, C/N) data integrated with digital elevation models. During the Middle Holocene, in response to RSL rise, the estuary saw mangrove forest establish up to ~37 km inland. RSL stood between -1.4 (+0.36/-2.2 m) and +1 (2.19/0.2 m) around 7400 cal yr BP, and rose to a highest position of +3.25 (4.22/2.45 m) reached around 5350 cal yr BP. That marine incursion caused the inland replacement of freshwater vegetation by mangroves on tidal flats. Since then, the estuary experienced RSL fall, reducing inland tidal water salinity towards the Late Holocene, making that the mangroves were replaced by freshwater floodplain vegetation. Today, in the seaward part of the estuary near its mouth, mangroves occupy an area of ~10 km2 along tidal channels. Considering a RSL rise of 98 cm up to the end of the 21st century, at a rate significantly higher than that of Middle Holocene RSL rise (1.5 mm/yr) and fall (0.6 mm/yr), the current mangrove substrates are expected to drown and/or eroded near the coast, while new mangroves may establish inland, at topographically higher tidal flats in nowadays freshwater-tidal zones. Mangrove area could expand over 13 km2 of coastal and flood plain. Following the same interaction between RSL/climate changes and Holocene mangrove dynamics, such upstream mangrove migration may be attenuated or intensified by changes in fluvial discharge. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The objective of this study was, therefore, to determine the extent to which K can be released from poorly available reserves over a long period of time. The focus was on an Oxisol in southern Brazil cultivated for 32 years with a rotation of soybeans (Glycine max L.), maize (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and oats (Avena strigosa L.) with and without K fertilization. Mineral sources of K were identified by X-ray diffraction and by sequential chemical extraction from the clay fraction. The amounts of K-bearing mineral species and the amounts of total and plant-available K were quantified, then the effects of the long-term K-fertilization regime on these values were evaluated. The clay fraction was dominated by hematite, gibbsite, and phyllosilicates such as kaolinite. These minerals were unaffected by the K deprivation in the cropping systems, but in the clay fraction the absence of K fertilization for 32 years reduced the structural order of the 2:1 phyllosilicates associated with K reserves. This effect was most prominent in the root zone of the soil. Deprivation of K for more than three decades decreased the crystallinity of 2:1 phyllosilicates, which could be better evaluated from XRD patterns after the removal of kaolinite and Fe (oxyhydr)oxides. The K-free cultivation reduced the amounts of total soil K by increasing the depletion of K from pools that typically are poorly accessible to plants. © 2020, The Clay Minerals Society.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of using encapsulated nitrate (EN) alone or combined with cashew nut shell liquid (EN + CNSL) to replace urea (UR) on intake and nutrient digestibility, nitrogen (N) balance, microbial nitrogen (MN) supply, carcass attributes, and meat quality of growing lambs. Eighteen Santa Inês male lambs (36.2 ± 5 kg of body weight; mean ± SD) were allocated individually to metabolic crates and fed a backgrounding diet with a 60:40 concentrate to forage ratio for 92 days. Lambs were assigned to a randomized complete block design with 6 blocks and 3 experimental diets: UR, 15 g urea/kg dry matter (DM); EN replacing UR at 45.1 g/kg DM; and EN + CNSL replacing UR at 45.1 g/kg DM. After finishing the digestibility and N balance trials, all lambs were fasted for 18 h, weighed, and then slaughtered. The dry matter intake (DMI) and nutrient digestibility were similar (P > 0.05) among treatments. The addition of EN or EN + CNSL tended to increase urinary NO3¯ excretion (P = 0.056) and NO2¯ excretion (P < 0.001). Compared to the UR diet, lambs fed EN or EN + CNSL diets decreased (P = 0.011) urinary UR concentrations. No differences (P> 0.05) in purine derivative excretion or daily MN supply were observed among treatments. The addition of EN or EN + CNSL did not affect (P > 0.05) hot or chilled carcass yields, chilling weight losses, or carcass pH. No differences (P > 0.05) in 12thrib longissimus muscle (LM) area, fat thickness, or color were observed. Fresh LM samples indicated no effects (P > 0.05) of EN or EN + CNSL on NO3¯ concentrations, and NO2¯ in LM samples was not detected.

However, its separation capacity is restricted by the use of short chromatographic columns and the limitations for gradient elution. The present work aimed to expand the analytical capacity of SIC by exploiting a multidimensional approach with two chromatographic columns, different in their separation mechanisms, which increased the selectivity and peak resolution. The viability of the proposal was demonstrated by separation of aromatic biogenic amines (histamine, tyramine, phenylethylamine, and tryptamine), whose unidimensional separation was not achieved either by using cyanopropyl or C18 chromatographic columns. In the two-dimensional approach, the fraction of the eluate unresolved in the first dimension (containing tyramine and phenylethylamine) was collected in a sampling loop and, subsequently, inserted in the second chromatographic dimension (heart-cutting mode). Under the optimized conditions, the first chromatographic dimension was based on a cyanopropyl monolithic column and an aqueous mobile phase composed of phosphoric acid solution, pH 2.5, while the second dimension employed a C18 superficially porous particle column and a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and phosphoric acid aqueous solution, pH 2.5 (7:93, v/v). The total analysis time was 8 min, and a resolution of 1.72 was achieved between the nearest peaks (tyramine and phenylethylamine). Linear responses were obtained within 10 and 50 mg L−1 (r > 0.997), with detection limits estimated at 2.7, 7.7, 1.9, and 0.3 mg L−1, for histamine, tyramine, phenylethylamine, and tryptamine, respectively, and a coefficient of variation of 3.0% (n = 12). © 2020	Article	Scopus

Most reports in environmental aquatic samples refer to cylindrospermopsin (CYN), and reports on other CYN alkaloids are scarce, due, in part, to a lack of versatile isolation protocols. Thus, using commercially available solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges, we optimized an isolation protocol for the complete recovery of CYN, 7-deoxy-cylindrospermopsin (7D-CYN) and 7-deoxy-desulfo-cylindrospermopsin (7D-desulfo-CYN) from the same aliquot. The isolation protocol was adaptable depending on the nature of the sample (solid biomass, culture broth or environmental water sample) and tolerates up to 4 L of dense culture broth or 400 mg of lyophilized biomass. To quantitate the CYN alkaloids, we validated an LC-DAD-MS2 method, which takes advantage of the UV absorption of the uracil group (γ 262 nm). Using electrospray ionization (ESI) in a positive ion mode, the high-resolution MS1 data confirms the presence of the protonated alkaloids, and the MS2 fragment assignment is reported as complementary proof of the molecular structure of the CYNs. We isolated three CYN alkaloids with different water solubility using the same lyophilized sample, with a purity that ranged from 95% to 99%. The biological activity of the purified CYNs, along with a synthetic degradation product of CYN (desulfo-cylindrospermopsin), was evaluated by assessing necrosis and apoptosis in vitro using flow cytometry. CYN's lethal potency in HepG2 cells was greater than the other analogs, due to the presence of all four functional groups: guanidine, uracil, C-7 hydroxyl and the sulfate residue. © 2020 by the authors.

Due to their exceptional high silt contents, these soils show different physical properties than common tropical soils. No pedotransfer functions (PTFs) for prediction of water contents for these unusual soils have been developed and regional PTFs developed by data from common Brazilian soils fail to give good predictions for the silty soils from Acre. To address this shortcoming, in this study we developed PTFs for water contents at specific pressure heads based on soil samples from silty soils of Acre. Samples were collected in soils under three land uses: native forest, integrated crop livestock systems and grazing pastures. Particle size fractions, bulk density, organic matter, cation exchange capacity, aggregate stability and water contents were measured with replicates. PTFs were developed per land use and for all data together using a stepwise linear regression (SL-PTF) and a random forest algorithm (RF-PTF), which performed much better than the regional PTFs. Determining some water contents in the pressure head range between 0 and –100 cm, together with θ15000 was enough to yield an accurate water retention curve for the entire range. PTFs developed using data from all land uses together resulted in a better prediction of water contents. The best PTFs for the prediction of water contents at specific pressure heads were developed by the random forest method. The developed PTFs using only sand, clay and organic matter contents and bulk density led to an acceptable prediction of water contents in the dry range. For the wet range, a robust performance was obtained when clay content, CEC and saturated water content were used as predictors. The predicted available water capacity in silty soils from Acre State was in the range between 5 and 10%, far below the amount required for optimum crop growth. The SL- PTF was a robust model as well but required more predictors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Recent studies have shown that nectariferous tissues are independent of the ABC model of floral development and that ecological interactions can modify their expression. In this sense, it would be interesting to study generalist species in relation to nectar production and nectary morpho-anatomy to verify the strategies used to attract different pollinator groups. We recorded nectar production dynamics in Aechmea vanhoutteana (Bromeliaceae) from a morpho-functional and ultrastructural perspective. We observed different species of hummingbirds, bees and butterflies visiting flowers of A.vanhoutteana, and their frequency varied throughout floral anthesis. The nectar volume and quantity of sugar also varied significantly during anthesis, and this spatial and temporal variability seems to be related to an increase in bee visits, representing an important aspect of the reproductive strategy of this species, since bees can fly longer distances than the observed hummingbirds (although both have territorial behaviours). Thus, it can be suggested that anatomical and physiological nectar traits may be related to pollen flow, an important aspect of the reproductive strategy of A. vanhoutteana, suggesting plant resource allocation for optimizing reproduction through nectar production. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.

Here, we present the first Brazilian isotopic baseline assessment that can be used not only in future forensic cases involving food authenticity, but also in human forensic anthropology studies. The δ13C and δ15N were determined in 1245 food items and 374 beverages; most of them made in Brazil. The average δ13C and δ15N of C3 plants were -26.7 ± 1.5‱, and 3.9 ± 3.9‱, respectively, while the average δ13C and δ15N of C4 plants were -11.5 ± 0.8‱ and 4.6 ± 2.6‱, respectively. The δ13C and δ15N of plant-based processed foods were -21.8 ± 4.8‱ and 3.9 ± 2.7‱, respectively. The average δ13C and δ15N of meat, including beef, poultry, pork and lamb were -16.6 ± 4.7‱, and 5.2 ± 2.6‱, respectively, while the δ13C and δ15N of animal-based processed foods were -17.9 ± 3.3‱ and 3.3 ± 3.5‱, respectively. The average δ13C of beverages, including beer and wine was -22.5 ± 3.1‱. We verified that C-C4 constitutes a large proportion of fresh meat, dairy products, as well as animal and plant-based processed foods. The reasons behind this high proportion will be addressed in this study.	Article	Scopus

We concluded that chicken and pork seem to be the dominant ingredients in most of the samples, with larger proportions in wet cat food. Even in pet foods showing ‘beef’ as the main ingredient on the label, we found a low proportion of bovine products in both wet and dry cat foods. Comparing the contribution of plant-derived products (C3 and C4 plants) and animal-derived products (chicken–pork, bovine and fish), approximately 21 % of cat foods had more than 30 % of ingredients with plant origin in their composition. The high amount of plant-derived products in cat foods found here raises the question whether this should be mentioned on package labels. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Different plant species can have a distinct influence on the bacterial assembly. However, genetic traits found in the same plant species, i.e. different plant genotypes, can also drive bacterial communities in rhizosphere. In this study, bacterial communities in a sandy soil (Fluvisol) and rhizosphere of four lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) genotypes were assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In general, Proteobacteria (23.3%), Actinobacteria (20.6%) and Firmicutes (12%) were the most dominant phyla in all samples. We found a distinct microbial structure between genotypes and bulk soil, with an increase of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and a decrease of Firmicutes in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil. Also, the results showed that different biological and chemical drivers of each lima bean genotype influenced bacterial structure. Interestingly, each genotype enriched specific microbial taxa in rhizosphere. Our data revealed that plants influenced bacterial assembly in rhizosphere even at a genotype level. The findings gathered in this study can contribute to identify some specific bacterial groups associated with distinct genotypes of lima bean and can drive further studies about the contribution of these bacterial groups on lima bean growth. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

These lakes are suspected to be a strong source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere, the water pH being one of the key factors in controlling the biogeochemical unctioning and, consequently, production and emission of GHGs in these lakes. Here, we present a new field-validated classification of the Nhecolândia lakes using water pH values estimated based on cloud-based Landsat (5 TM, 7 ETM+, and 8 OLI) 2002-2017 time-series in the Google Earth Engine platform. Calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance collections with the Fmask method were used to ensure the usage of only cloud-free pixels, resulting in a dataset of 2081 scenes. The pH values were predicted by applying linear multiple regression and symbolic regression based on genetic programming (GP). The regression model presented an R2 value of 0.81 and pH values ranging from 4.69 to 11.64. A lake mask was used to extract the predicted pH band that was then classified into three lake classes according to their pH values: Freshwater (pH < 8), oligosaline (pH 8-8.9), and saline (≥9). Nearly 12,150 lakes were mapped with those with saline waters accounting for 7.25%. Finally, a trend surface map was created using the ALOS PRISM Digital Surface Model (DSM) to analyze the correlation between landscape features (topography, connection with the regional drainage system, size, and shape of lakes) and types of lakes. The analysis was in consonance with previous studies that pointed out that saline lakes tend to occur in lower positions compared to freshwater lakes. The results open a relevant perspective for the transfer of locally acquired experimental data to the regional balances of the Nhecolândia lakes. © 2020, by the authors.	Article	Scopus

A passive phenomenon called hydraulic redistribution (HR) allows some plant species to take up water from deep and wet soil layers and redistribute it in the upper dry layers where other plants and soil biota can benefit from it. In addition, soil fertilization, particularly potassium (K), may also affect drought-adaptive mechanisms and increase water use efficiency (WUE) on poor and acidic tropical soils. The present study aimed at quantifying the role of HR and K fertilization on both wood productivity and WUE for stemwood production (WUEp) of Eucalyptus grandis plantations in Brazil under ambient and reduced (−37%) throughfall conditions. Tree transpiration was measured using trunk sap flow sensors over 21 months, and HR was estimated from the reverse sap flow (RF) observed in shallow roots over 18 months. Tree biomass, hydraulic conductance, soil water storage from surface to the water table (down to 17 m), and leaf photosynthetic capacity were also assessed. Significant HR was detected over the whole year, even during the rainy seasons. Neither potassium fertilization nor throughfall exclusion affected the velocity of water transported by HR, probably because most trees reached water table. Nonetheless, some photosynthetic capacity parameters, including the maximum photosynthetic rate (Amax), increased in treatments with K addition. This higher Amax combined with an increased sapwood area index, was associated with an increase in water uptake by 30 %–50 % and WUEp by 300 % relative to K-deficient trees. We postulate that the increase in WUEp promoted by potassium fertilization was partly driven by an increase in biomass allocation to wood, at the expense of foraging organs (leaves and roots), because K addition alleviated constraints on light and water use.

Therefore, they may help tackle global food and energy insecurity and climate change in the coming decades. We investigated the effects of integrated crop-livestock (ICL) and integrated crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) systems on quantity, quality, and origin of soil organic matter (SOM) in southeastern Brazil. A native forest and an extensive low-grazing intensity pasture system were used as references. In integrated systems, corn (Zea mays) was alternated with two consecutive years of piatã grass (Urochloa bryzantha) for cattle grazing. In ICLF, eucalyptus trees (Eucalyptus urograndis) were planted in simple rows of 15 × 2 m. Soil sampling was performed three times; in 2014, after two years of grazing; in 2015, after crop cultivation; and in 2016, after a successive grazing year, to evaluate chemical and physical composition changes of organic matter (C, N, δ13C, δ15N, and organic matter fractions) with time. Our findings showed that from 2010 to 2016, all systems (extensive grazing, ICL and ICLF) promoted increments on soil C and N stocks. However, land intensification converting extensive low-grazing intensity pasture to ICL was the most promising strategy, increasing soil C stocks at the rate of 0.28 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 from 2010 to 2016. Annual crop cultivation (corn intercropped with piatã grass) promoted high organic matter inputs on the soil, increasing the amount of soil labile organic matter fractions, which presented higher δ13C and lower δ15N values over time. SOM in the integrated farming systems was originated mainly from C4 plants. Therefore, optimizing development of piatã grass and corn increases organic residue inputs and then, soil C and N stocks. In addition, the crop period increased soil fertility parameters, which favors plant growth, thus providing high labile C inputs to the soil. In contrast, land intensification by adding the forestry component into the system (i.e., conversion from ICL to ICLF) reduced soil C (-0.22 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) and N (-0.03 Mg N ha−1 yr−1) stocks from 2010 to 2016, likely due to the reduction of C and N inputs to the soil caused by limited growth of annual crop and grass species under tree shades. In conclusion, land use intensification through ICL system contributes towards a more efficient and low-C agriculture, whereas the studied ICLF system did not bring further benefits to increase the quantity and/or quality of SOM. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Gossypol is a polyphenolic compound, commonly found in cotton seeds, that impairs male reproduction. Here, we investigated whether the exposure to gossypol in utero and during lactation alters male reproductive function in sheep. From conception until 60 days postpartum, ewes were randomly assigned to a control diet or a gossypol-rich diet based on cottonseed. Lamb testicles were removed at 60 days of age and subjected to RNA-sequencing. Results: Lambs derived from the maternal cottonseed diet showed significantly lower growth and lower testis weight as a proportion of the total body weight, and reduced testosterone levels. In addition, the testis transcriptome was significantly altered by the maternal cottonseed diet. Most of the altered genes are directly implicated in testis development and sperm biology, cell communication, iron ion metabolism, calcium homeostasis and signaling, among other functions. Interestingly, network analysis revealed that exposure to gossypol significantly disturbed coexpression patterns among spermatogenesis-related genes, suggesting a disruption in coregulation mechanisms. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence that maternal exposure to gossypol alters male reproductive function in the offspring, with potential lasting or lifelong negative consequences. © 2020 The Author(s).

Free-living nematodes (FLN) are commonly found in soils and serve as prey for many acarine predators. Our goal was to determine whether conservation biological control of plant-parasitic nematodes by predators could be enhanced by provisioning FLN with their culture medium (FLNCM) under semi-field conditions. We conducted two experiments on dwarf tomato plants, the first until the beginning of flowering and the second until harvest. The treatments evaluated were with and without: 1) the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, 2) the predator Stratiolaelaps scimitus, and 3) the FLN Rhabditella axei in its culture medium. In both experiments, gall abundance was lowest in the combined treatment of FLN and predators. Similar reduction in gall abundance occurred when only predators or only FLNCM was added to the soil mix. Additionally, in the FLNCM treatment, foliar macronutrients N and K were significantly higher than the negative control. Our original aim was to use FLN as a supplementary food source for predators in conservation IPM. Based on the significant reduction in gall numbers, and the increase in foliar macronutrients, it is clear that the FLNCM treatment played additional roles. Finally, for demonstration, the predation of M. incognita was visualized in high resolution imaging using a low-temperature-scanning electron microscope. Accordingly, we recommend that future research focus on identifying soil amendments that will foster the establishment of beneficial microbiota, FLN and soil predators for the conservation biological control of soil pests. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

It seems that nanomaterials can affect plant metabolism trough root, seed or leaf exposure. However, results are still contradictory, either due to specificities regarding plant species and nanomaterials properties, or because of the lack of an experimental protocol that includes at least ionic and bulk positive controls for nanomaterials. The mechanisms behind nanoparticle absorption and transport are still not clear. Other major issue that must be faced concerns the unrealistic high nanomaterials concentrations to which plants have been exposed. There are many opportunities in this topic, specially related to the usage of nanomaterials as fertilizers and bioestimulants to increase plant productivity, resistance to diseases and drought stress. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

After 10 years of use of pig manure (PM) in a crop succession with black oat/maize, undisturbed soil samples were collected in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm layers, in the treatments without PM (control) application, with application of PS and DL at a dose equivalent to one and two times the N recommended for maize and black oat, respectively. The aggregates were separated according to the biogenic and physicogenic formation pathway. Then, these aggregates were separated into macro, meso and microaggregates. In these aggregates the TOC was determined in the macro, meso and microaggregates and only in the macroaggregates for the C of the oxidizable fractions (fractions F1, F2, F3 and F4). Application of PS increases the TOC contents in the microaggregates while the DL increases TOC in macroaggregates. The use of DL for a long time increases the labile carbon (F1) and recalcitrant carbon (F4) in comparison to PS and control. Oxidizable carbon fractions showed differences between biogenic and physicogenic aggregates, being greater in the biogenic aggregates. © 2020, Asociacion Argentina de la Ciencia del Suelo.

Sixty 14-day-old male chickens were assigned into two treatment groups (5 birds/pen, n = 6) in a cafeteria-type study: the control (C) group, and the TM group. Each pen was equipped with one bell drinker and four through feeders allocated side by side; all feeders of the C group contained a complete standard diet whereas each feeder of the TM group contained one of the following ingredients: ground corn, extruded semi-whole soybean, vitamin-mineral supplement mixture, and TM meal. Feed intake was recorded daily and growth was monitored periodically up to day 32. Chickens which had access to individual feed components showed a delay to display preference for TM, but consumed, overall, up to 50% of the total intake as TM meal. Feed intake and growth performance were lower in all periods for TM group (p < 0.02), whereas feed conversion ratio was improved on days 22–28 and days 29–32 of age (p < 0.01). Data from bivariate and multidimensional analysis indicate that birds started to reach a balance of ingredient intake at 25 days of age, showing a high correlation between consumption of each ingredient and the day of the experiment. Chickens exhibited a preference for T. molitor meal, resulting in improved feed efficiency, which allows us to conclude that it can be a suitable feed alternative for poultry. © 2020 by the authors.

It may reproduce sexually and asexually, with a well-defined parasexual cycle. The current paper demonstrates that the limitation of nitrogen source facilitates the production of A. nidulans's nonmeiotic recombinants directly from heterokaryons, without the recovery of the diploid phase. Heterokaryons formed between master strains were inoculated in sodium nitrate-low (basal medium [BM]) and sodium nitrate-rich media (minimal medium [MM]). All mitotic segregants produced by the heterokaryons were tested for their mitotic stability in the presence of benomyl, the haploidizing agent. Only mitotically stable haploid segregants were selected for subsequent analysis. Phenotypic analyses of such haploids favored the characterization of nonmeiotic recombinants. As the number of such recombinants was higher in BM than in MM, nitrogen limitation may have facilitated the isolation of nonmeiotic recombinants from heterokaryons by stimulating nuclear fusion still inside the heterokaryotic mycelium as a survival strategy. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Most commonly, SHP are determined by conventional methods (CM), based on hydrostatic equilibrium and the independent measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity, which is used as a matching point for K(h) function. Alternatively, inverse-modeling experiments allow simultaneous parameter estimation using data from transient water flow conditions. This study aims to investigate the implications of these two protocols on simulations of soil water content (θ) and crop evapotranspiration (ET), and how they affect irrigation management and scheduling for different irrigation systems and crops. The SHP obtained from CM and IM were used in simulations with the Richards equation-based SWAP hydrological model. ET and θ were simulated for passion fruit under high-frequency drip irrigation and for pasture under conventional sprinkler irrigation. The simulation performance was evaluated using measured θ and ET obtained with passion fruit under drip irrigation. Both methods (CM and IM) gave similar results in the wetter range, while in the drier soil, CM estimated higher θ than IM. These differences affected the simulated ET and irrigation scheduling. Regarding the ET and θ simulations, for the drip irrigation scenario, in which the water content in the root zone remains near saturation, both SHP determination methods produced similar results. On the other hand, for scenarios with larger irrigation intervals such as sprinkler irrigation, simulations were affected significantly, with CM likely biasing irrigation frequency and depth. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

However, the movement of these fungicides within seedlings is not always well characterized. Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine the pattern of translocation of three fungicides with different modes of action applied as a seed treatment, and the effect of soil type on translocation. RESULTS: Most of the absorbed radioactivity was concentrated in the cotyledons and the maximum sum of the rates of absorption by roots, stems, and leaves of the plants was 15%. In most cases, absorption by roots, stems, and leaves were lower than 5% for 14C-pyraclostrobin and 14C-metalaxyl, and 1.6% for 14C-carbendazim. Fungicides absorbed by the roots and the whole seedlings were higher when plants were grown in soil with lower organic matter content. Fungicides in the cotyledons are unlikely to be redistributed and are lost when cotyledons fall off the plants. CONCLUSION: Cotyledons are the part of the plant where fungicides are most absorbed, regardless of the fungicide. Soil type affects the absorption of fungicides, and in this study it was most likely caused by soil organic matter. These data improve knowledge of the movement of seed treatment fungicides in soybean seedlings and may help the development of seed treatment chemistry to manage seed and soilborne pathogens. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry	Article	Scopus

The isolation of strains from tropical environments seems to be an important step in the search for molecules displaying bioactivity, besides being valuable for biotechnological purposes. Thus, the objective of the present study was to describe marine cyanobacterial strains, isolated and characterized in terms of morphology and molecular phylogeny, as well as screened for biologically active compounds. Five strains were isolated and morphologically characterized as Leptolyngbya (CENA553, CENA554 and CENA555) and Geitlerinema (CENA552 and CENA556). Considering the phylogenetic results, these strains did not match the clusters of the type-species or reference strains, indicating the possible emergence of new generic entities morphologically related to Leptolyngbya and Geitlerinema. Among the isolated strains, CENA552 and CENA556 were selected for chemical analyses. Five known nucleosides with biological activities and two amino acids were recognized and isolated from the CENA556 strain. The GC-MS analyses of strains CENA552 and CENA556 revealed distinct classes of non-polar compounds, with a predominance of octadecane (CENA556), 2-hexyl-1-decanol (CENA552) and neophytadiene (CENA552 and CENA556) hydrocarbons. All nucleosides and amino acids were highly abundant, indicating these morphotypes as promising sources of these bioactive compounds. This is the first report considering taxonomy/molecular phylogeny as well as chemistry prospection of morphotypes resembling Geitlerinema-like isolated from the Brazilian coastal area, highlighting the potential of these taxa for biotechnological applications. © 2020 The Author(s).

Macrotiloma (Macrotyloma axillare) is a tropical legume that still lacks studies regarding its effects on animal performance and CH4 emissions. Aims: The objective of this experiment was to evaluate productive performance, CH4 emission, ruminal fermentation parameters, carcass characteristics and fatty acid profile of the meat from lambs fed tropical grass hay supplemented with the legume forage macrotiloma. Methods: For a 90-day experimental period, 14 Santa Inês male lambs (aging 100 days; 18.06 ± 3.26 kg initial bodyweight) were allocated in individual pens and divided into two treatments: chopped aruana grass (Panicum maximum cv. Aruana) hay (CON); aruana hay supplemented with chopped macrotiloma hay at a ratio of 75: 25 grass to legume (MAC). Lambs were weighed fortnightly for calculation of average daily bodyweight gain (ADG) and CH4 emission was measured on three occasions (days 28 to 32; 57 to 61; 85 to 89) using the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer technique. At the last day of CH4 collection, rumen fluid samples were collected for: determination of ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA); ruminal protozoa count; and relative abundance determination of general bacteria (BACT); Ruminococcus flavefaciens (RUMI); Fibrobacter succinogenes (FIBRO); methanogenic archaea (METH) by real-time quantitative PCR (real-time-qPCR) analysis. Subsequently, after 16 h fasting, the animals were slaughtered; carcass characteristics were then evaluated and longissimus thoracis samples were collected for fatty acid profile analysis. Key results: No significant difference (P > 0.05) was observed between MAC and CON for productive performance, CH4 emission, SCFA and carcass characteristics. Reduced protozoa count and relative abundance of METH were observed for MAC (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Despite the lack of effects on productive performance and CH4 emission, the decreased relative abundance of METH and protozoa count indicated that macrotiloma may possibly present anti-methanogenic activity. Implications: The inclusion of this legume in the diet of ruminants may affect rumen microbes and potentially decrease environmental impacts of the production system. © 2020 CSIRO.	Article	Scopus

However, a critical evaluation of the procedures for the extraction of the analytes and hydrolysis of the conjugated forms of SA is lacking in the literature and the available alternatives are complex, time-consuming, and laborious. In this study, the sample preparation methods for SA fractionation were critically evaluated to develop a simpler and faster alternative procedure. Microwave-assisted extractions were carried out with 2.0 g of fresh leaves and 8.0 mL of a 75% v/v ethanol:water solution at 40 °C for 10 min, followed by alkaline hydrolysis using 100 μL of 0.1 mol L−1 NaOH at 80 °C for 60 min. Free and total SA were determined in crude and hydrolyzed extracts, respectively, by fluorimetry after chromatographic separation of the sample matrix under isocratic elution (25% v/v acetonitrile/phosphate buffer) using a C18 column. Recovery experiments using methyl salicylate and acetylsalicylic acid model compounds demonstrated that the soft microwave-assisted extraction did not decompose the SA derivatives and that alkaline hydrolysis was quantitative. The proposed procedure was successfully applied for fractionation of SA in sugarcane, corn, and soybean leaves with extraction and hydrolysis yields up to 70 and 20% higher than those achieved in previously proposed approaches, respectively. The developed procedure is a simple, fast, and reliable alternative for SA fractionation in crude extracts without sample clean-up, and utilizes dilute reagents and green solvents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

XRF instrumental parameters were optimized in a univariate way, and emission intensities were measured for 60 s and under vacuum for macronutrients, and during 180 s, under air, and 305 μm Al/25.4 μm Ti filter, for micronutrients. Fresh and dried leaves were irradiated, and it was possible to identify P, K, Ca, S, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn Kα emission lines. For comparative purpose, the samples were also microwave assisted, digested and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. In general, linear correlations between K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn concentrations in the tested samples and the corresponding portable XRF (pXRF) intensities were obtained. The linear correlation coefficients (R2) ranged from 0.42 to 0.86. In addition, the detection limits were suitable for plant nutrient diagnosis. It is demonstrated that pXRF is a simple and powerful tool for analysis of plant materials. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	Article	Scopus

The experimental set-up comprised a multi-commuted flow system module and homemade photometer, which used a light-emitting diode as the radiation source. The photometric method relies on the reaction of diphenylthiocarbazone (dithizone) with Hg(II) ions in alkaline medium. The obtained compound was extracted with chloroform and detected at 488 nm. In addition, the parameters that could affect the complex formation and extraction efficiency, such as, the acidity, reagent concentration, time for reaction development and extraction, and volume of extracting solvent, were studied. Under optimal conditions, a linear response that ranged from 0.25 to 10.0 μg L−1 (r2 = 0.9926) was achieved. The accuracy of the method was assessed using the sample spiking and recovery methodology. According to the results, recoveries between 90% and 116% were achieved for both the soil and sediment samples, which were appropriate for these types of samples. In addition, the samples were analyzed via cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry. The paired t-test with nine degrees of freedom revealed that no significant differences existed between the results. Other figures of merit, namely the limit of detection of 0.018 μg L−1, coefficient of variation of 0.32% (n = 10), sampling throughput of 22 determinations per hour, dithizone, and chloroform consumptions of 0.13 µg and 0.55 mL, respectively, per determination, were achieved. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This work aimed at evaluation of a simple modeling approach consisted of Compton normalization (CN) and multivariate regressions (e.g., multiple linear regressions (MLR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR)) to overcome the soil matrix effect, and subsequently improve the prediction accuracy of key soil fertility attributes. A portable XRF was used for analyzing 102 soil samples collected from two agricultural fields with contrasting soil matrices. Using the intensity of emission lines as input, preprocessing methods included with and without the CN. Univariate regression models for the prediction of clay, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and exchangeable (ex-) K and Ca were compared with the corresponding MLR models to assess matrix effect mitigation. The MLR and PLSR models improved the prediction results of the univariate models for both preprocessing methods, proving to be promising strategies for mitigating the matrix effect. In turn, the CN also mitigated part of the matrix effect for ex-K, ex- Ca, and CEC predictions, by improving the predictive performance of these elements when used in univariate and multivariate models. The CN has not improved the prediction accuracy of clay. The prediction performances obtained using MLR and PLSR were comparable for all evaluated attributes. The combined use of CN with multivariate regressions (MLR or PLSR) achieved excellent prediction results for CEC (R2 = 0.87), ex-K (R2 ≥ 0.94), and ex-Ca (R2 ≥ 0.96), whereas clay predictions were comparable with and without CN (0.89 ≤ R2 ≥ 0.92). We suggest using multivariate regressions (MLR or PLSR) combined with the CN to remove the soil matrix effects and consequently result in optimal prediction results of the studied key soil fertility attributes. The prediction performance observed for this solution showed comparable results to the approach based on the preprogrammed measurement package tested (Geo Exploration package, Bruker AXS, Madison, WI, USA). © 2020 by the authors.

This study assessed the composition of volatile compounds, phenolics and carotenoids in two allele-introgressed tomato lines, an anthocyanin-rich purple tomato and a β-carotene-rich orange tomato, as well as a red tomato. RESULTS: The purple tomato peel accumulated a high amount of anthocyanins, mainly petunidin 3-(p-coumaroyl)-rutinoside-5-glucoside, responsible for the purple color, and other flavonoids such as rutin and kaempferol. The orange tomato did not undergo changes in the flavonoid profile but accumulated a high amount of β-carotene, with impairment on lycopene. A total of 27 volatile compounds were detected in purple tomato, 38 in orange tomato and 39 in red tomato. They comprise terpenes, carbonyls, alcohols, esters and hydrocarbons. The difference in the volatile compound profiles of ripe fruits can be related to differences in some precursor contents in the introgression lines. Orange tomato accumulates volatiles from β-carotene cleavage, not detected in the red fruits. Otherwise, volatiles from lycopene were absent in orange tomato as a result of the inhibition on lycopene accumulation. Phenolic volatiles were higher in the purple tomato, which has the highest total phenolic content. CONCLUSION: The introgessed alleles seem to have a positive effect on the enrichment of ripe tomato in bioactive compounds such as anthocyanins and β-carotene, improving nutritional quality. However, the allele introgression resulted in marked changes in volatile compound profiles, whose impact on tomato flavor and consumer acceptability needs to be evaluated. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry	Article	Scopus

It is also the least understood and monitored. Although this potent cholinesterase inhibitor was first reported in the 1970s and connected with animal poisonings, the lack of chemical standards and identified biosynthetic genes together with limited diagnostics and acute reactivity of this naturally-occurring organophosphate have limited our understanding of its environmental breadth and human health implications. Anatoxin-a(S) irreversibly inhibits acetylcholinesterase much like other organophosphate agents like paraoxon. It is however often confused with the similarly named anatoxin-a that has a completely different chemical structure, mechanism of action, and biosynthesis. Herein we propose renaming of anatoxin-a(S) to clarify its distinct structure and mechanism and to draw renewed attention to this potent natural poison. We propose the new name guanitoxin (GNT) to emphasize its distinctive guanidino organophosphate chemical structure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

In this regard, shredder macroinvertebrates play an important role in decomposing organic matter. Changes in land use strongly influence the type of material entering a stream, which ultimately affects the food chain dependent on this material. This study compared the decay of C3 (Mollinedia schottiana) and C4 (Brachiaria brizantha) plants in the montane Atlantic Forest of Brazil using litterbag experiments in two streams draining watersheds of different land uses. Concomitantly, we investigated the colonisation and assimilation of these plant detritus by aquatic macroinvertebrates. The breakdown of C4 plants in the forest stream was faster than that of C3 plants; however, aquatic macroinvertebrates did not assimilate the C4 carbon. These results support other studies that have shown a greater abundance of shredders in montane tropical streams (lower temperature) than in lowland streams. Moreover, the findings of this study support the view that changes in land use alter the structure of the benthic community, and that these changes can alter the leaf breakdown process.  © 2020 CSIRO.

The pathogen infects citrus flowers, produces orange-brown lesions on petals, and may cause the abscission of young fruit. In diseased flowers, the calyxes remain attached to the peduncle after the young fruit drop. No anatomical and microanalysis studies have been conducted to determine whether calyx tissues can be infected by Colletotrichum spp. and why calyxes remain attached to the peduncle. Based on light microscopy, we demonstrate that the ovary abscission zone exhibits a separation region composed of layers of thickened lignified walled cells, indicating that abscission involves the disruption of cell walls. The first layers of the protective zone (PZ) are composed of densely packed cells with suberized walls produced by the wound meristem. Beneath the PZ, there is a compact mass of small cells that accumulate starch grains. X-ray fluorescence microanalysis (µ-XRF) confirmed the increased accumulation of calcium in the receptacle of the persistent calyxes compared to non-inoculated citrus flowers. Moreover, the peduncle pith and the receptacle exhibit hypertrophied cells with thick walls that may be related to calyx retention.

The present study investigated the influence of supplementation with Cr bound to organic molecule on the nutritional, immune, and antioxidant quality of ewe colostrum. Thirty-two multiparous Santa Ines ewes (55.3 ± 8.00 kg body weight) were randomly assigned into four groups: T1 (0.0 mg of chromium picolinate (CrPic) supplementation per ewe, n = 8), T2 (0.15 mg of CrPic per ewe, n = 9), T3 (0.30 mg of CrPic per ewe, n = 7), and T4 (0.45 mg of CrPic per ewe, n = 8). Supplementation was supplied during the breeding season, pregnancy, and lactation. Shortly after calving, the first milking colostrum was collected to determine its chemical composition, activity of lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, ceruloplasmin, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity. The results show that lactoperoxidase activity decreased with CrPic supplementation (P < 0.01), revealing that this micromineral reduces an important component of defense mechanism in the body. Therefore, the results of this work show that supplementation with chromium picolinate influences colostrum quality. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

However, there is no specific information available regarding whether Se can affect the anatomical structure and photosynthetic rates of plants under Cd stress. To address questions related to Se-protective responses under Cd stress, we evaluated the structural and ultrastructural aspects, photosynthetic rates and growth of tomato cv. Micro-Tom plants. Plants were exposed to 0.5 mM CdCl2 and further supplemented with 1.0 μM of selenite or selenate. The overall results revealed different trends according to the Se source and Cd application. Both Se sources improved growth, photosynthesis, leaf characteristics and middle lamella thickness between mesophyll cells. In contrast, Cd caused decreases in photosynthesis and growth and damage to the ultrastructure of the chloroplast. The number of mitochondria, peroxisomes, starch grains and plastogloboli and the disorganization of the thylakoids and the middle lamella in plants increased in the presence of Cd or Cd + Se. Se plays an important role in plant cultivation under normal conditions. This finding was corroborated by the identification of specific structural changes in Se-treated plants, which could benefit plant development. However, a reversal of Cd stress effects was not observed in the presence of Se. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.	Article	Scopus

As MEC and MICal are adopted by an increasing number of laboratories, questions on their working ranges, the most appropriate calibration standard concentration (Cstd) to be used, and the best approach to calculate limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) have been raised. In this study, we evaluate the effects of working with different combinations of Cstd and analyte concentration in the sample (Csam) on the accuracy of MEC and MICal. Chromium, Cu and Mo are used as models for MEC determinations by microwave-induced plasma optical emission spectrometry (MIP OES) and inductively coupled plasma OES (ICP OES), and MICal determinations by ICP mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), respectively. We use the error propagation approach to determine LODs and LOQs, evaluate the effect of employing different values of Cstd in these calculations, and compare the results with those from external standard calibration (EC) using the IUPAC approach. Finally, we apply MEC and MICal to analyze certified reference materials and compare the results with those from the traditional standard additions (SA) method. Although presenting usually higher LODs and LOQs compared to EC, MEC and MICal generally provide trueness similar to, and sometimes better than, SA. LOD and LOQ calculations based on the error propagation approach provide robust results, and trueness and precision depend on the calibration slope and the analyte level in the sample. The best results for MEC and MICal are found when working within the 0.1 < calibration slope < 0.9 range. A simple pre-analysis test comparing the analytical signal recorded for the sample (Isam) and a calibration standard (Istd) may ensure such conditions if 0.11 < Isam/Istd < 9.00. MEC and MICal are simple and efficient alternatives to EC and SA. They are particularly effective for minimizing matrix effects and analyzing complex-matrix samples. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.	Article	Scopus

These compounds are photoprotective and some have additional antioxidant functions. Thus, mycosporine-like amino acids may be used as an active ingredient in cosmetic products. Analysis is generally achieved by separation using reverse-phase chromatography and, detection and quantification based upon characteristic absorption spectra and extremely high molar extinction coefficients. Herein, a validated liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) quantification method for mycosporine-like amino acids is presented. Additionally, an easy-to-handle and rapid extraction procedure was developed, which uses only water and volatile additives as the extractor solvents. The LC-MS/MS method was performed with an electrospray ionization source in positive mode using multiple reaction monitoring with a reverse-phase column. The method enabled the accurate determination and quantification of the mycosporine-like amino acids porphyra-334, shinorine and mycosporine-glycine-alanine in a 6 min running time, with detection limits of 0.002 μg mg− 1, 0.001 μgmg− 1 and 0.005 μg mg− 1, respectively. These methods provided a simple extraction and rapid analysis procedure that efficiently identified and quantified these three mycosporine-like amino acids produced by a collection of 29 cyanobacteria. Although more mycosporine-like amino acids have also been identified, the validated method was developed focusing on the most abundant mycosporine-like amino acids produced by the investigated cyanobacteria. Mycosporine-like amino acids could be detected at levels well above the limits of detection for the LC-MS/MS method in 12 strains, irrespective of whether the cultures had been exposed to ultra-violet radiation. High levels of constitutive expression of mycosporine-like amino acids in cyanobacteria has rarely been reported and provides an opportunity to study mechanisms that regulate ultra-violet radiation induced mycosporine-like amino acids biosynthesis in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of the present study was to assess the risk for human health due the consumption of tilapia farmed in net cages in eight aquaculture parks in Brazil. The concentrations of pesticides (40 compounds), metals (Mn, Ni, Zn, Cd, Pb, and Sn), arsenic, and cyanotoxins (microcystins) were evaluated in 16 fish from each park. Among analyzed pesticides, pyraclostrobin (0.18–0.32 mg/kg) and fenthion (0.0026–0.0037 mg/kg) exhibited values above the limit of quantification in the tilapia from Aracoiaba, Castanhão, and Ilha Solteira. The highest concentrations of As (0.44 μg/g) in fish tissues were found in Juara, Mn (0.21 μg/g) in Castanhão, and Zi (11.5 μg/g) were found in Três Marias. Furnas and Linhares exhibited the lowest metal concentrations. The estimated daily intake of muscle by the average Brazilian with 70 kg body weight is below the reference dose for all studied metals in all parks. Total free microcystins showed an accumulation pattern (muscle < gill < liver). The highest concentration in muscle was found in Castanhão (1043 μg/kg) samples. The results showed that fish exhibited metal, As, and pesticide tolerable daily intake (TDI) below the limit and pose low risk for human consumption. Otherwise, TDI for microcystins in fish of all studied parks was above the maximum level recommended by the World Health Organization, indicating that there exists a toxicity risk of fish consumption. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The randomized block experimental design was used with eight treatments and five replicates, as follows: two controls with single cherry tomato crop (with and without corn straw cover); cherry tomato intercropped with jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis DC); white lupine (Lupinus albus L.); sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.); velvet bean-dwarf [(Mucuna deeringiana (Bort) Merrill)]; mung bean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek), and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp). The number of total fruits, the weight of total fruit and an average weight of the total fruit in the first year was 25%, 33% and 13% higher than the second-year, respectively. The lower N-content of cherry tomato leaves in the treatment with mung bean can be reflected of lower %N transfer of cherry tomato leaves in the same treatment compared to treatment with cowpea bean. The N-content and %N transfer of cherry tomato leaves was 50 and 42% higher in year 1 than in year 2, successively. Nevertheless, in general, the legumes used in this study contributed equally in the N transfer to the cherry tomato plants. The P, K, Mg, Ca, Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn content in the leaf and shoot were no difference between the treatments. However, the Mg, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn content of the leaf were higher in year 2 than year 1. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	Article	Scopus

Due to the diversity of raw materials used in its production, the biofuel can show significant differences in its physicochemical properties, which causes severe matrix effects in biodiesel analysis. In this work, a calibration strategy recently proposed for atomic spectrometry, named multi-energy calibration (MEC), was evaluated as a tool to circumvent matrix effects in molecular spectrometry. The strategy yielded more accurate results in the spectrophotometric determination of the iodine value and free glycerol in biodiesel produced from different raw materials (root mean square error of prediction, RMSEP, values of 6.0 and 8.0, respectively), than both external standard calibration (EC, RMSEP as high as 45.6) and the standard additions method (SAM, RMSEP as high as 25.3). Moreover, results agreed with those obtained by the reference procedures at the 95% confidence level, which was not observed for EC (free glycerol determination) and SAM (iodine value determination). Coefficients of variation (n = 8) and limits of detection (99.7% confidence level) were, respectively, estimated at 1.7% and 5 g I2/100 g iodine value and 3.0% and 10 mg kg−1 free glycerol in biodiesel, which are comparable to or better than those achieved using previously proposed procedures. Thus, MEC is a viable alternative for biodiesel quality control, with outstanding minimization of matrix effects, simplicity, practicality, and environmental friendliness. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This demands the cultivation of plants in shrinking land areas which makes the search for highly effective systems for plant nutrition and pest control important. In this context, the application of nanoparticles (NPs) in agriculture can have a transformative effect on food production techniques as it can enable the delivery of bioactive agents (including growth factors, pesticides, and fungicides) directly to plants. Herein, we report the application of unfunctionalized as well as amine-functionalized and polycaprolactone-coated Fe3O4 NPs to seed treatment in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The study reveals that the treatment has no side effects on plant germination and development. Furthermore, the translocation of NPs in seeds and seedlings posttreatment depends on the surface functionalization of the NPs. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy analysis of seedlings suggested that around 66% of unfunctionalized Fe3O4 NPs were translocated in the cotyledons, while only 50% of functionalized NPs (both amine and polycaprolactone) were translocated. Our results demonstrate that all particles were taken up by the seeds, thus suggesting that the functionalized NPs can act as a versatile platform for delivering of active compounds, such as fungicides and growth factor agents. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

In this work, an analytical method was developed based on near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and principal component analysis (PCA) to study an Oxisol submitted to different land uses (primary forest; secondary forest; fruit growing; horticulture; degraded pasture; improved pasture and annual agriculture.) in the Brazilian Eastern Amazon. The results of PCA using diffuse reflectance spectra showed 97 % of the total variance explained in PC1 and PC2, indicating the formation of four sample groups related to different uses and linked to the physico-chemical attributes (contents of carbon, nitrogen, potassium and density) of the soil. The analytical method developed, based on NIR spectra and PCA, is a promising way to identify soils subjected to different uses. © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica. All rights reserved.

We aimed to assess the effect of N-fertilizer sources and rates on sugarcane yield, biomass partitioning, juice quality, nutrient accumulation, and N efficiency in acid soils. Two field experiments were carried out in southeastern Brazil for consecutive five years. Six N-fertilizer managements [ammonium nitrate and urea at a rate of 100 kg N ha− 1 (AN100 and UR100, respectively), calcium ammonium nitrate at a rate of 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha− 1 (CAN50, CAN100, CAN150, and CAN200, respectively)] were applied to acidic soils. Nitrogen fertilization did not affect sugarcane and sugar yields at the site with previous rotation with peanut (Arachis hypogea) before crop replanting. Conversely, at the site under continuous monoculture, AN100, CAN100, and CAN150 showed increases of 7–25% in sugarcane and sugar yields, and 3–7% in Brix and recoverable total sugar content. We conclude that in responsive sites, fertilizer N additions improve crop yield and juice quality, although high N inputs in the long term (> 100 kg N ha− 1) can reduce sugarcane sustainability. Similarly, non-responsive sites can exhibit substantial economic losses and environmental pollution. Identifying responsive and non-responsive sites to fertilizer N is required for improving N use efficiency and reducing environmental risks and economic losses. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Many strategies, such as soil fertilization, nutrient foliar spraying, and seed treatment have been proposed to this goal. Currently, plenty of studies in plant nutrition afford only a low mass of sample for analyses, which is not sufficient for most spectroscopic techniques, including conventional energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (EDXRF). In this context, we developed a new EDXRF method for the determination of nutrients in mass-limited soybean plant tissues. Soybean seeds were treated with different types of Zn suppliers (ZnSO4 and ZnO nanoparticle sources), sowed, and soybean roots and shoots were sampled two weeks after germination. For EDXRF analysis, 20 mg of samples were suspended in 1 mL of deionized water, and 20 μL of the suspension were dried on a 6 μm polypropylene film in an X-ray cup. External calibration using a set of synthetic aqueous cellulose multielemental standards suspended in 1% Triton X-100 proved to be a good strategy for quantification purposes. The trueness of the proposed method was verified analyzing several plant tissue certified reference materials. Additionally, soybean samples were also analyzed by using a validated total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) method, and good agreement was found between both analytical approaches. To sum up, the proposed EDXRF thin film method is straightforward and reliable for mass limited vegetal sample multielemental analysis and, additionally, follows the green analytical chemistry postulates. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Crop residues left on the soil are important to maintain a positive SOM budget and nutrient cycling. But, sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) straw has been removed from the field for bioenergy purposes. We hypothesize that global warming, together with straw removal, will negatively impact Brazil’s ethanol carbon footprint. Thus, we conducted an experiment under controlled conditions to evaluate the impacts of warming and straw removal on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil carbon and nitrogen storage, and nutrient cycling. Two soils (Rhodic Acrisol and Eutric Nitisol) were tested with three rates of sugarcane straw removal (no removal (NR): equivalent to 12 Mg ha−1; medium removal (MR): 6 Mg ha−1; and total removal (TR): bare soil) and submitted to two temperatures (24 °C and 30 °C) and soil moistures (30% and 50%). Straw decomposition was stimulated by lower rates of straw removal, resulting in increases on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions between 5 to 14 times, and N2O between 25 and 40%. There were no significant methane (CH4) fluxes. Soil carbon and nitrogen did not change due to straw removal, yet labile carbon fractions (living and non-living) were highly impacted, causing reductions of 15 to 40% on the carbon management index (CMI). Furthermore, straw removal reduced nutrient cycling between 10 and 30%. Overall, in a scenario of warming, our findings point to an intensification of SOM dynamic, resulting in increases of 35% on the GHG emissions and a CMI reduction by 20%. In practical terms, at least 6 Mg ha−1 of straw should be left in the field, guaranteeing raw-material for bioenergy, without causing major impacts on the GHG emission and soil attributes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

Marandu (moderately tolerant) and Urochloa brizantha cv. Xaraés (more tolerant). Our objective was to evaluate differences in the response to Al-induced stress between these genotypes, focusing on Al compartmentation in the root apoplast and symplast, and antioxidant enzyme activities after Al exposure. Al-accumulation was 25% higher in the roots of cv. Xaraés than cv. Marandu, while in the shoot Al accumulation was 150% higher in cv. Marandu than cv. Xaraés. U. brizantha cv. Marandu accumulated 73% of the Al absorbed in the root symplast and 27% in the root apoplast, while cv. Xaraés accumulated 61% of the Al absorbed in symplast and 39% in apoplast. Furthermore, Al exposure leaded to physiological and developmental changes in root morphology, such as disorganization of vascular system, the collapse of cortical cells and absence of root hairs from the root tip, with more drastic effects detectable in cv. Marandu. Catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX) activities in the roots of cv. Marandu were lower compared to cv. Xaraés. Our results pointed out that higher Al compartmentalization rates in the root apoplast, altogether with up-regulated metabolic activities of CAT and GPOX and also lower long distance transport of Al are seemingly at the base of the Al tolerance in cv. Xaraés. In conclusion, biochemical analysis of roots suggested that understanding of metabolic pathways is one of pressing approach to elucidate stress tolerance mechanisms in this genus. © 2019	Article	Scopus

Included in this group are the species Phyllosticta capitalensis, a group of fungi that include saprobes that produce bioactive metabolites. The present study aimed to identify the cultivable endophytic fungal microbiota present in healthy leaves of Tibouchina granulosa (Desr.) Cogn. (Melastomataceae) and investigate secondary metabolites produced by a strain of P. capitalensis and their effects against both Leishmania species and Trypanossoma cruzi. Identification of the strains was accomplished through multilocus sequencing analysis (MLSA), followed by phylogenetic analysis. The frequency of colonization was 73.66% and identified fungi belonged to the genus Diaporthe, Colletotrichum, Phyllosticta, Xylaria, Hypoxylon, Fusarium, Nigrospora, and Cercospora. A total of 18 compounds were identified by high-resolution mass spectrum analysis (UHPLC-HRMS), including fatty acids based on linoleic acid and derivatives, from P. capitalensis. Crude extracts had activity against Leishmania amazonensis, L. infantum, and Trypanosoma cruzi, with inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 17.2 μg/mL, 82.0 μg/mL, and 50.13 μg/mL, respectively. This is the first report of the production of these compounds by the endophytic P. capitalensis isolated from T. granulosa. © 2019, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.	Article	Scopus

Because BA determination is important for food quality evaluation, and considering the relatively complex analytical procedures available, new approaches are required for their determination. In this work, an environmentally friendly analytical procedure is proposed for BA determination in cheese, involving separation by sequential injection chromatography without organic solvents or chemical derivatization of the analytes. Sample preparation step was carried out by acid protein precipitation and low-temperature partition with a reduced volume of organic solvent (500 µL of acetonitrile). Because of the previously mentioned characteristics, an analytical eco-scale = 91 was achieved. Histamine, tyramine, and tryptamine were separated in a cyanopropyl monolithic column in the isocratic elution mode, with 3.0 mmol L−1 phosphoric acid aqueous solution as mobile phase. The analytes were quantified from their intrinsic absorption at 210 nm. The analysis time was less than 3 min, with good chromatographic efficiency (N ≥ 75000 plates m−1). For the three analytes, LOD within 0.05–0.10 mg kg−1, LOQ within 0.14–0.30 mg kg−1, and linear response ranges up to 10 mg kg−1 (histamine and tyramine) and 15 mg kg−1 (tryptamine) were achieved with good precision (CV = 3.0%, n = 12). The proposed procedure was successfully applied to the determination of tyramine in cheese samples, with recoveries in the 81–128% range. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

We analyzed carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios to estimate percent contributions of different prey to snake biomass, trophic positions and isotopic niche width of juveniles and adults of the snake Thamnodynastes hypoconia. We also estimated the isotopic niche overlap between the two age categories. During eight intervals over a two-year period, we collected samples of whole blood and scales at a site in southern Brazil. Isotopic ratios of carbon and nitrogen did not differ between juveniles and adults for either tissue type, nor did mean trophic positions of juveniles and adults differ. The percent contribution of prey categories to snake biomass differed to a limited extent between the two years, with Hylidae being the most important anuran group assimilated during the first year and Leptodactylidae during the second year, for both ages. The isotopic niche occupied by adult snakes was slightly larger than that of juveniles when the analysis was based on data from whole blood samples, as expected because snakes are gape-limited. We found a reverse pattern when the analysis was based on scales, which may indicate that adult snakes have a smaller niche over the long term as they become selective foragers in certain prey. Isotopic overlap between juveniles and adults occurred during the two years, but it was bigger during the second year. We infer that, despite differences in gape size, juvenile and adult snakes in the study area exploit similar prey, with the degree of trophic similarity varying interannually. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH	Article	Scopus

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the dry biomass productivity and total accumulation of nutrients in the cover crops shoots and in the upland rice grown in succession; and evaluate the effect of the isolated and combined use of cover crops and urea on upland rice crop, grown under no-tillage system. The field experiment was conducted at Selviria-MS, Brazil, in an Oxisol (Rhodic Ilaplustox), cerrado (savannah) phase. The experimental design was randomized blocks, in a 5x3 factorial scheme. The treatments were four cover crops species: sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.), green velvet bean (Mucuna prurens), millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), and spontaneous vegetation (fallow in off-season) combined with 20 kg N ha-1 applied at sowing, 20 kg N ha-1 applied at sowing + 60 kg N ha-1 at plus topdressing, and without mineral N fertilizer application. The millet recycled large amounts of K, Mg, S, and micronutrients, but negatively influenced the rice grain yield grown in succession. There was no response to topdressed mineral N fertilizer when the crop was grown in rotation to legume cover crops. Upland rice under no-tillage showed a positive response to the N fertilization at seeding and when it is grown in rotation with the use of millet or fallow in the off-season. Upland rice also showed a response to N fertilization applied at topdressing. © 2020, Korean Society of Crop Science and Springer.	Article	Scopus

Here, we assessed the diversity of bacterial, fungal and cercozoan communities in landraces and modern varieties of wheat. The dominant taxa within each group were the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria; the fungi phyla Ascomycota, Chytridiomycota and Basidiomycota; and the Cercozoa classes Sarcomonadea, Thecofilosea and Imbricatea. We showed that microbial networks of the wheat landraces formed a more intricate network topology than that of modern wheat cultivars, suggesting that breeding selection resulted in a reduced ability to recruit specific microbes in the rhizosphere. The high connectedness of certain cercozoan taxa to bacteria and fungi indicated trophic network hierarchies where certain predators gain predominance over others. Positive correlations between protists and bacteria in landraces were preserved as a subset in cultivars as was the case for the Sarcomonadea class with Actinobacteria. The correlations between the microbiome structure and plant genotype observed in our results suggest the importance of top-down control by organisms of higher trophic levels as a key factor for understanding the drivers of microbiome community assembly in the rhizosphere. © 2020 FEMS 2020.

This expansion is constrained by water policy goals to restrict water scarcity to acceptable levels. We therefore analysed the trade-off between levels of acceptable water scarcity and feasible expansion of irrigation. The appropriateness of water use in agricultural production was assessed in categories ranging from acceptable to very critical based on the river flow that is equalled or exceeded 95% of the time (Q95) as an indicator for physical water availability. The crop water balance components were determined for 166 842 subcatchments covering all of Brazil. The crops considered were cotton, rice, sugarcane, bean, cassava, corn, soybean and wheat, together accounting for 96% of the harvested area of irrigated and rain-fed agriculture. On currently irrigated land irrigation must be discontinued on 54% (2.3 Mha) for an acceptable water scarcity level, on 45% (1.9 Mha) for a comfortable water scarcity level and on 35% (1.5 Mha) for a worrying water scarcity level, in order to avoid critical water scarcity. An expansion of irrigated areas by irrigating all 45.6 Mha of the rain-fed area would strongly impact surface water resources, resulting in 26.0 Mha experiencing critical and very critical water scarcity. The results show in a spatially differentiated manner that potential future decisions regarding expanding irrigated cropping areas in Brazil must, while pursuing to intensify production practices, consider the likely regional effects on water scarcity levels, in order to reach sustainable agricultural production. © Author(s) 2020.

Materials and methods: In the Center-West, Northeast, and Amazon regions of Brazil, fingernails were sampled in clusters encompassing a major city, town, and rural village. A total of 2,133 fingernails were analyzed. Fingernails were clipped by donors using fingernail clippers. In the laboratory, samples were cleaned then weighed in small tin capsules before being isotopically analyzed for carbon and nitrogen. Results: The overall mean δ13C and δ15N were −19.7 ± 2.8‰ and 10.6 ± 1.1‰, respectively. In the more remote villages, where access to food markets is more challenging, lower δ13C prevails, suggesting that Brazilian staple foods (rice, beans, and farinha) still dominate. In areas with easier access to food markets, δ13C values were higher, suggesting a change to a diet based on C4 plants, typical of a Brazilian supermarket diet. The variability among inhabitants in the same location expressed by a significant inverse correlation between δ13C and δ15N fingernail values suggested that “market integration” does not affect everyone equally in each community. Discussion and Conclusion: The nutrition transition has not yet reached some remote villages in these regions of Brazil or that the nutrition transition has not yet reached all residents of these remote villages. On the other hand, in several villages there is a considerable adherence to the supermarket diet or that some residents of these villages are already favoring processed food. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Urea is the most often used form of N fertilizer in Brazil; however, it can experience high losses by volatilization, primarily in pastures with high amounts of senescent biomass. The goal of this study was to evaluate losses by ammonia volatilization from urea coated with Cu, B, and Se. The fertilizer was applied to the soil surface under forage straw residues in cylindric glass chambers under controlled laboratory conditions. The treatments were urea (UR), urea coated with boric acid and copper sulfate (UBC), urea coated with boric acid, copper sulfate, and selenium (UBCS), and ammonium sulfate (AS). Measurements were recorded at regular intervals after fertilizer application for 27 days. High losses occurred from ammonia volatilization of amidic-N sources in the initial days after fertilizer application. The total loss of N by ammonia volatilization according to fertilizer treatment was UR > UBC = UBCS > AS. Urea lost by ammonia volatilization accounted for up to 50% of the N applied, although losses from coated urea treatments UBC and UBCS were 11.45% lower than that of urea. The Cu and B in the coated urea reduced losses by ammonia volatilization and the inclusion of Se had no effect. It is suggested that Se may be added to the Cu and B coating of urea to reduce ammonia volatilization. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Londrina. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

The objective of this work was to evaluate the production and the composition of coastcross grass for hay production by sprinkler irrigation with urea effluent treated by the anaerobic exercise. The experimental was developed in randomized blocks, with five treatments and four replicates (5 × 4), with time subplots. The five treatments used were: (i) T1 - irrigation with surface water plus 50.0 kg ha−1 cut−1 nitrogen fertilization (NF) provided as urea; (ii) T2, T3, T4 and T5 - irrigation with treated slaughterhouse effluent (TSE) plus 0, 16.5, 33.0 and 50 kg ha−1 cut−1 NF. The variables analyzed were the production of fresh and dry mass, soil chemical characteristics and prospective and bromatological analysis, during the winter and the summer. After the treatment, the effluent showed elevated concentration of total nitrogen (176.00 ± 52.32 mg L−1) and a low to moderate saline potential (EC = 1.46 ± 0.34dSm−1). In the winter the nutritional status and the coastcross grass production were kept by irrigation with the effluent, compared with the surface water treatment saving 100% of the nitrogen fertilization. The percentage of phosphorus, sodium and base saturation of the soil were altered by the wastewater. During the summer, the irrigation sludge with effluent were reduced due to rainfall inhalation, with less nutrients support. The higher precipitation occurrency at this season reduced the total amount of salt in the soil. The total production (winter and summer) of dry mass and fresh dough were superiors with the 100% NF treatments, regardless of the water source. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

As any sample handling step of a flow-based analytical procedure can be accomplished in different ways, there are multiple facets associated to it. This tutorial is focused on the critical evaluation of these facets and the proposal of a novel way to present the flow analyzers, disregarding or even avoiding the need for specifying flow modalities and acronyms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Merrill] and then investigated the effects of such coatings on germination and finally monitored the transference of Zn from the coatings to the seedlings. For that, seeds were coated with ZnSO4, 40 nm ZnO, and 5 µm ZnO at 4 mg of Zn per kg of seed. The shape and homogeneity of Zn deposits on the seed surface depended on the type of Zn source. X-ray spectroscopy unraveled that before the germination, Zn neither crossed the seed coat nor was biotransformed. Regardless of the particle size, ZnO-based treatments increased germination ratio, seedlings root, and shoot development, whereas ZnSO4 suppressed them. After sowing, most of Zn on the seed coat was transferred to soil, while less than 13 wt% was assimilated by the seedling 14 days after sowing. Either this minor fraction of Zn was taken up during the imbibition process or absorbed by during seedling growth. Zinc oxide-based treatments represent a viable alternative to Zn supply in order to boost soybean germination and seedling development. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	Article	Scopus

Although short-term drying and warming are known to affect forests, it is unknown if such effects translate into long-term responses. Here, we analyze 590 permanent plots measured across the tropics to derive the equilibrium climate controls on forest carbon. Maximum temperature is the most important predictor of aboveground biomass (-9.1 megagrams of carbon per hectare per degree Celsius), primarily by reducing woody productivity, and has a greater impact per °C in the hottest forests (>32.2°C). Our results nevertheless reveal greater thermal resilience than observations of short-term variation imply. To realize the long-term climate adaptation potential of tropical forests requires both protecting them and stabilizing Earth's climate. © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Moreover, Ca, Mg and S are essential for the establishment of this plant in large areas. Better acknowledgment of appropriate nutrient levels can help with proper fertilization. This study aimed to gain insight during initial growth in Jatropha plants deficient in Ca, Mg and S by measuring leaf gas exchange, nutrient uptake efficiency (UpE), nutrient use efficiency (UtE) and biomass partitioning at plant harvest. Chlorophyll, carotenoid concentration, net photosynthesis rate (A), stomatal conductance (gS), transpiration (E), leaf-scale intrinsic water use efficiency (IWUE) and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency (k) in leaves of Ca-, Mg- and S-deficient plants revealed imbalances prior to visual symptom appearance. Nutrient deficiencies decreased A, which in turn hindered plant growth and biomass partitioning among leaves, stem and roots. However, S-deficient plants maintained values of UtE (at 120 days after S withdrawal), as well as of A, gS, E, k and biomass allocation similar to those of control plants, during all evaluation periods. Jatropha was highly and very sensitive to Ca and Mg deficiency, respectively, with all results were dramatically decreased in contrast to the control. In conclusion, early physiological evaluation of Ca and Mg status in starved young plants with contrasting UtE values may be a reliable tool with which to predict early nutritional deficiencies before visual symptom appearance. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In mammals, part of the offspring phenotype is influenced by dam nutrition. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ewe diet, with and without cottonseed (gossypol), on the testicular development of lambs from birth to weaning through the assessment of lamb live weight (LW), macro and histological morphology of testes, and mass fraction of chemical elements by neutron activation analysis (NAA) and microprobe X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as the multielement distribution map in the testes. Eighteen lambs were used with an average LW at birth of 4 ± 1.0 kg. All lambs were offspring of Santa Inês ewes, fed on ration either with or without cottonseed during mating, gestation, and lactation, thus forming two treatments: control group (C) without cottonseed and treatment group with cottonseed (G). The animals were weighed from birth to 60 days of age, at fortnightly intervals. At 60 days of age, the lambs were orchidectomized to collect their testes for macroscopy, histological, neutron activation, and X-ray fluorescence analysis. Besides dry matter (DM), protein, ether extract (EE), calcium (Ca), and potassium (K) were higher in the ewe milk from the C group compared with the G group (P < 0.05). Lambs from the C group showed higher LW from 45 days onwards, as well as higher average daily gain when compared with the G group (P < 0.05). They also presented higher testicular weight, volume, length, width, as well as tubule and lumen diameters compared with lambs from the G treatment (P < 0.05). Multielementary NAA revealed higher mass fractions of rubidium (Rb), selenium (Se), and cesium (Cs) in the testes of lambs from the C group when compared with the G group, while G showed higher zinc (Zn) content (P < 0.05). No differences between treatments were found for element levels and distribution using X-ray fluorescence microanalysis (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the maternal cottonseed diet compromised performance and testes development of the lambs and reduce the content of Se in the testes. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

These compounds have photoprotective and antioxidant functions and have been widely studied for possible use in sunscreens and anti-aging products. This study aims to identify MAA-producing cyanobacteria with potential application in cosmetics. Methods: A method for the identification of MAAs was developed using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-DAD/QTOFMS). Chromatographic separation was carried out using a Synergi 4 μ Hydro-RP 80A column (150 × 2,0 mm) at 30°C with 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution + 2 mM ammonium formate and acetonitrile/water (8:2) + 0.1% formic acid as a mobile phase. Results: Out of the 69 cyanobacteria studied, 26 strains (37%) synthesized MAAs. Nine different MAAs were identified using UHPLC-DAD/QTOFMS. Iminomycosporines were the major group detected (7 in 9 MAAs). In terms of abundance, the most representative genera for MAA production were heterocyte-forming groups. Oscilatoria sp. CMMA 1600, of homocyte type, produced the greatest diversity of MAAs. Conclusions: The UHPLC-DAD/QTOFMS method is a powerful tool for identification and screening of MAAs in cyanobacterial strains as well as in other organisms such as dinoflagellates, macroalgae, and microalgae. The different cyanobacterial genera isolated from diverse Brazilian biomes and environments are prolific sources of MAAs. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	Article	Scopus

However, studies on the effects of raw feedstock and biochar are scarce. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of amending soils from three Midwestern U.S. states, with biochar produced from soybean residues, sugarcane bagasse, and wood chips (grape) as well as raw feedstock on the sorption–desorption and leaching potential of the pesticides aminocyclopyrachlor, metolachlor, and imidacloprid. Soil was amended at 10% (w w−1), and sorption–desorption studies were performed using the batch equilibration method. Following the determination of the sorption coefficient (Koc) values, the groundwater ubiquity score (GUS) indices for these pesticides were calculated. The highest pesticide sorption in all unamended soils followed the order imidacloprid (Kd = 0.79–1.66 L Kg−1) > metolachlor (Kd = 0.54–0.61 L Kg−1) > aminocyclopyrachlor (Kd = 0.12–0.23 L Kg−1). Biochar has the potential to decrease metolachlor and imidacloprid availability in soil through increased sorption, while the availability of aminocyclopyrachlor differed between the use of raw feedstock and biochar. Biochar derived from wood chips had the highest impact on pesticide behavior.

In this context, we recorded nectar production dynamics from a morphofunctional perspective using the hummingbird-pollinated Billbergia distachia (Bromeliaceae). The scale-throated hermit Phaethornis eurynome was the only floral visitor observed, indicating a specialized pollination system. Nectar production showed significant differences between day and night, and the periods of major pollinator activity and nectar secretion were synchronous. The ultrastructural features of the nectary showed some evidence of nectar reabsorption in flowers at night, and it can be inferred that this process may be a key factor in the nocturnal pause in nectar production. In this way, nectary morphoanatomy, nectar traits and an energy-saving mechanism through nectar reabsorption contribute to the well-established relationship between B. distachia and P. eurynome. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.

However, this bacterial community may vary among different plant species and their response to soil contamination, such as the application of composted tannery sludge (CTS) and Cr contamination. In this study, we assessed the bacterial community in nodules of cowpea and lima bean grown in soils with low and high rates of Cr-rich CTS. Bulk soil samples and nodules from cowpea and lima bean were collected for assessing the bacterial community by high-throughput sequencing. The bacterial diversity and the proportion of specialist bacterial species in the nodules of cowpea were higher than the lima bean. However, the bacterial diversity of the nodule was not influenced by CTS and Cr rate. The microbiome of the nodules was dominated by Proteobacteria (97.6%), followed by Actinobacteria (1.1%), and Firmicutes (0.4%). The dominant bacterial group in the nodules was Bradyrhizobium, accounting for >90% of the sequences. The functional prediction showed 26 groups, with the core functions represented by chemoheterotrophy (32.3%), followed by aerobic chemoheterotrophy (32%), nitrification (12.7%), and ammonia oxidation (11.2%). This study revealed specific differences in the nodule microbiome between the two plants species and, although suggested that the nodule microbiome was not affected by the CTS application, the functional prediction data showed that the treatments with Cr-rich CTS increased the abundance of sequences affiliated to aerobic ammonia oxidation and nitrification in the nodules. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This research aimed to evaluate sorption, leaching, and biodegradation of 14C-SDZ in four acidic soils from Brazil, using OECD guidelines. Except for the sand soil (Kd = 2.6 L kg−1), SDZ sorption tended to be higher (Kd > 8.4 L kg−1) and more hysteretic (ΔH >> 1) in acidic soils. When freshly applied, SDZ leaching was low (< 0.11% of applied radioactivity (AR)) and could not always be predicted by Kd values; but leaching was restricted when SDZ was aged for 62 days. SDZ mineralization was low (< 3%) but its dissipation was fast (DT50 < 2.3 days and DT90 < 6.3 days) due to fast initial degradation (an unknown metabolite was immediately formed, likely 4-hydroxysulfadiazine) and mainly to fast formation of non-extractable residues (NER) (> 78% of AR up to 7 days). For certain acidic soils, the abrupt breakdown of the SDZ suggests that degradation should be initially chemical and then followed by enzymatically driven reactions. The fast formation of NERs was attributed mostly to chemical bounding to soil humic substances (Type II-NER), but SDZ sequestration cannot be ruled out (Type I-NER). NERs represent a long-term environmental reservoir of SDZ that may cause deleterious effects on non-target organisms as well as promote antibiotic resistance to soil microbes. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The objective was to evaluate the effect of consecutive plants growth on Ni availability and enzymatic activities in the rhizosphere. It was evaluated the interaction between BS ratios (50% and 70%) and Ni application rates (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 10.0 mg dm−3 of soil) on the availability of Ni in the rhizosphere. Two agricultural crops were grown in succession (soybean and sunflower). The effects of Ni rates and BS ratios on the activity of the urease and dehydrogenase in the soil were evaluated. Ni distribution in the bulk soil fractions was also investigated by Ni sequential extraction. The objective was to evaluate the effect of consecutive plants growth on Ni availability and enzymatic activities in the rhizosphere. It was observed the Ni availability was higher in the rhizosphere than bulk soil. The plant species have a large influence on the enzymatic activities in the rhizosphere. Urease activity was higher in the rhizosphere with BS70 under soybean growth, whereas for sunflower, BS50 lead to the highest urease activity, in all rates. The dehydrogenase activity was greater with BS70, regardless of plant species. The extractants Mehlich-1, Mehlich-3, and diethylenetriamine penta acetic acid (DTPA) showed comparable ability to estimate the available Ni fraction in the rhizosphere with a significant correlation with Ni accumulation in the grains. The Ni sequential extraction results showed the predominant effect of pH on the availability of Ni in bulk soil. Ni bound to organic matter (OM) was the fraction that showed the greatest BS influence. In soil under BS50, up to 20% of total Ni in the soil was bound to OM. Increasing Ni application rates to the soil increased the exchangeable fraction of Ni in the bulk soil up to 36-fold, but did not cause toxicity for either crops. Collectively, the results showed that nickel availability in rhizosphere affected urease and dehydrogenase activities, Ni uptake, and plant growth-related responses to different extents. Our work suggests that the rhizosphere should be evaluated for Ni monitoring in Ni-supplied agricultural areas. © 2019; One sentence summary: An interactive effect between soil base saturations and nickel rates were examined in two consecutive plant species showed that nickel availability in soil–rhizosphere affected urease and dehydrogenase activities, Ni uptake, and plant growth-related responses to different extents. © 2019	Article	Scopus

Little focused work, however, has addressed how neonatal nutritional state is affected by differing degrees of maternal investment associated with these markedly different reproductive strategies. To investigate the effect of maternal investment on the nutritional quality of pups during the early life history of an extremely viviparous elasmobranch, quantitative bio-marker analysis including lipids, fatty acids and stable isotopes was conducted. Using the cownose ray Rhinoptera bonasus (histotrophic viviparous) as a model, we found that pups were initially born in a positive nutritional state, enriched in physiologically important essential fatty acids and nitrogen and carbon stable isotope values (δ15N and δ13C), a result of maternal intrauterine transfer. A systematic decrease in some fatty acids and δ15N values, as well as a decrease in cholesterol with growth, confirmed that these substrates were derived from maternal resources and used in initial metabolic processes following birth. An observed increase in condition factor, plasma essential fatty acids and triglyceride: cholesterol ratio with increasing body size identified a progression towards successful independent foraging with pups not displaying marked nutritional deficiency or fasting phases. Our multi-tracer approach allowed the identification of 2 size classes of young rays (<50 and <70 cm disc width) that displayed distinct physiological states. Since prenatal maternal investment is critical for offspring condition and to promote successful foraging post birth, understanding the trophic ecology and physiological state of pups during their first year is critical to guide management and conservation within nursery grounds. © Inter-Research 2020.

In Brazil, the National Biotechnology Technical Commission (CTNBio) requires a survey of the area of natural occurrence of wild relatives of the GMO in the Brazilian ecosystems to evaluate the possibility of introgressive hybridization between sexually compatible species. Modern sugarcane cultivars, the focus of this study, derive from a series of hybridization and backcrossing events among Saccharum species. The so-called “Saccharum broad sense” group includes around 40 species from a few genera, including Erianthus, found in various tropical regions, particularly South-Eastern Asia. In Brazil, three native species, originally considered to belong to Erianthus, were reclassified as S. angustifolium (Nees) Trin., S. asperum (Nees) Steud., and S. villosum Steud., based on inflorescence morphology. Thus, we have investigated the potential occurrence of gene flow among the Brazilian Saccharum native species and commercial hybrids as a requisite for GMO commercial release. A comprehensive survey was carried out to map the occurrence of the three native Saccharum species in Brazil, concluding that they are sympatric with sugarcane cultivation only from around 14°S southwards, which precludes most Northeastern sugarcane-producing states from undergoing introgression. Based on phenology, we concluded that the Brazilian Saccharum species are unable to outcross naturally with commercial sugarcane since the overlap between the flowering periods of sugarcane and the native species is limited. A phylogenomic reconstruction based on the full plastid genome sequence showed that the three native Saccharum species are the taxa closest to sugarcane in Brazil, being closer than introduced Erianthus or Miscanthus. A 2-year study on eight nutritional composition traits of the 20 main sugarcane cultivars cultivated in Brazil was carried out in six environments. The minimum and maximum values obtained were, in percent: moisture (62.6–82.5); sucrose (9.65–21.76); crude fiber (8.06–21.03); FDN (7.20–20.68); FDA (4.55–16.90); lipids (0.06–1.59); ash (0.08–2.67); and crude protein (0.18–1.18). Besides a considerable amount of genetic variation and plastic responses, many instances of genotype-by-environment interaction were detected. © Copyright © 2020 Bressan, Carvalho, Borges, Carneiro, Silva, Gazaffi, Shirasuna, Abreu, Popin, Figueira and Oliveira.

The novelty of this work was to determine the effects of season and elevated CO2 under field conditions upon biomass production and nutritional value of Brachiaria decumbens during 2 years. The Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment was established in twelve rings: six of them being the control (current atmosphere) and others six fumigated with pure CO2 to achieve a higher concentration (e[CO2]). In each ring, two 0.25 m2 plots have been established with B. decumbens and after standardization cut, green forage yield was evaluated frequently. Plant samples were collected at 20 cm height and evaluated for determining the biomass production, nutritive value and in vitro enteric methane (CH4) production. Season and year had significant effect (P < 0.01) upon all the studied variables. Biomass production, acid detergent fibre and cellulose contents of samples from e[CO2] were statistically greater (P < 0.05). Carbon, nitrogen and crude protein content were within the normal range and as well as CH4 production were not altered by e[CO2] (P > 0.05). Overall, e[CO2] and rainfall seasons significantly increased forage production, contributing to sequester carbon in plant biomass, but this C4 tropical grass must be grazed at its best protein and fermentable carbohydrate ratio for advantages in the rumen microbial synthesis and lowering CH4 production intensity of the production system. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

This work aimed at assessing the performance of a portable XRF (XRF) sensor set up with two different X-ray tube configurations (combinations of voltage and current) to predict nine key soil fertility attributes: (clay, organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, base saturation (V), and extractable nutrients (P, K, Ca, and Mg). An XRF, operated at a voltage of 15 kV (and current of 23 μA) and 35 kV (and current of 7 μA), was used for analyzing 102 soil samples collected from two agricultural fields in Brazil. Two different XRF data analysis scenarios were used to build the predictive models: (i) 10 emission lines of 15 keV spectra (EL-15), and (ii) 12 emission lines of 35 keV spectra (EL-35). Multiple linear regressions (MLR) were used for model calibration, and the models' prediction performance was evaluated using different figures of merit. The results show that although X-ray tube configuration affected the intensity of the emission lines of the different elements detected, it did not influence the prediction accuracy of the studied key fertility attributes, suggesting that both X-ray tube configurations tested can be used for future analyses. Satisfactory predictions with residual prediction deviation (RPD) ≥ 1.54 and coefficient of determination (R2) ≥ 0.61 were obtained for eight out of the ten studied soil fertility attributes (clay, OM, CEC, V, and extractable K, Ca, and Mg). In addition, simple MLR models with a limited number of emission lines was effective for practical soil analysis of the key soil fertility attributes (except pH and extractable P) using XRF. The simple and transparent methodology suggested also enables future researches that seek to optimize the XRF scanning time in order to speed up the XRF analysis in soil samples. © 2020 by the authors.

The advancement of these applications is limited by a lack of robust geospatial models that are capable of capturing variation in soil δ15N (i.e., isotopic landscapes or isoscapes). Due to the complexity of the nitrogen cycle and general scarcity of isotopic information, previous approaches have reconstructed regional to global soil δ15N patterns via highly uncertain linear regression models. Here, we develop a new machine learning approach to ascertain a finer-scale understanding of geographic differences in soil δ15N, using the South American continent as a test case. We use a robust training set spanning 278 geographic locations across the continent, spanning all major biomes. We tested three different machine learning methods: cubist, random forest (RF), and stochastic gradient boosting (GBM). 10-fold cross-validation revealed that the RF method outperformed both the cubist and GBM approaches. Variable importance analysis of the RF framework pointed to biome type as the most crucial auxiliary variable, followed by soil organic carbon content, in determining the model performance. We thereby created a biogeographic boundary map, which predicted an expected multiscale spatial pattern of soil δ15N with a high degree of confidence, performing substantially better than all previous approaches for the continent of South America. Therefore, the RF machine learning framework showed to be a great opportunity to explore a broad array of ecological, biogeochemical, and forensic issues through the lens of soil δ15N. © 2020 The Authors.

Selenium application at high concentration to plants can cause toxicity decreasing the physiological quality of seeds. This study aimed to characterize the Se toxicity on upland rice yield, seed physiology and the localization of Se in seeds using X-ray fluorescence microanalysis (μ-XRF). In the flowering stage, foliar application of Se (0, 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 g ha−1) as sodium selenate was performed. A decrease in rice yield and an increase in seed Se concentrations were observed from 250 g Se ha−1. The storage proteins in the seeds showed different responses with Se application (decrease in albumin, increase in prolamin and glutelin). There was a reduction in the concentrations of total sugars and sucrose with the application of 250 and 500 g Se ha−1. The highest intensities Kα counts of Se were detected mainly in the endosperm and aleurone/pericarp. μ-XRF revealed the spatial distribution of sulfur, calcium, and potassium in the seed embryos. The seed germination decreased, and the electrical conductivity increased in response to high Se application rates showing clearly an abrupt decrease of physiological quality of rice seeds. This study provides information for a better understanding of the effects of Se toxicity on rice, revealing that in addition to the negative effects on yield, there are changes in the physiological and biochemical quality of seeds. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Samples containing fungal enzyme extracts were analyzed and characterized by spectrophotometric and electrophoresis analysis. Results showed that the maximum fungal biomass production (11.7 g protein L−1) and laccase activity (424.9 IU L−1) were recorded on the 10th day, whereas manganese-peroxidase activity reached a maximum (100.9 IU L−1) on the 12th day of incubation. Based on the melanoidin degradation, the optimum vinasse decolorization (99.17%) was concomitant with an increase in laccase and manganese-peroxidase activity. Further, the increase in antioxidant enzyme activity such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) indicated a vinasse-induced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, based on the results, the fungus P. sajor-caju can be applied for sugarcane wastewater treatment once this fungus resists to a stressful environment and maintains its homeostasis during vinasse biodegradation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

However, the influence of VOCs on growth and root architecture in soybean remains unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that VOCs would enhance the growth of soybean and change its root architecture. Thus, experiments under growth chamber were carried out to investigate the effect of VOCs released by B. subtilis AP-3 on growth and root architecture of soybean (control and plants exposed to VOCs) and eight replicates. Plant growth and root architecture parameters in soybean were measured 20 days after soybean emergence. Soybean exposed to microbial VOCs displayed significant increase in plant biomass (88% and 18% for shoot and roots, respectively) than the control. Microbial VOCs changed the root architecture of soybean that exhibited roots with higher length, diameter, surface area, and volume. The principal component analysis differentiated plants exposed to VOCs from those plants without exposure. The findings from this study are important since the modulation of root architecture can improve the absorption of water and nutrients from the soil. © 2020, Brazilian Society of Plant Physiology.

The lack of adaptation to cultivation conditions and the existence of highly structured populations make association mapping of diversity panels not optimal. Joint linkage mapping of nested populations avoids the later constraint, while populations crossed with a common domesticated parent allow the evaluation of wild variation within a more adapted background. Three domesticated by wild backcrossed-inbred-line populations (BC1S4) were developed using three wild accessions representing the full range of rainfall of the Mesoamerican wild bean distribution crossed to the elite drought tolerant domesticated parent SEA 5. These populations were evaluated under field conditions in three environments, two fully irrigated trials in two seasons and a simulated terminal drought in the second season. The goal was to test if these populations responded differently to drought stress and contained progenies with higher yield than SEA 5, not only under drought but also under water-watered conditions. Results revealed that the two populations derived from wild parents of the lower rainfall regions produced lines with higher yield compared to the domesticated parent in the three environments, i.e., both in the drought-stressed environment and in the well-watered treatments. Several progeny lines produced yields, which on average over the three environments were 20% higher than the SEA 5 yield. Twenty QTLs for yield were identified in 13 unique regions on eight of the 11 chromosomes of common bean. Five of these regions showed at least one wild allele that increased yield over the domesticated parent. The variation explained by these QTLs ranged from 0.6 to 5.4% of the total variation and the additive effects ranged from −164 to 277 kg ha–1, with evidence suggesting allelic series for some QTLs. Our results underscore the potential of wild variation, especially from drought-stressed regions, for bean crop improvement as well the identification of regions for efficient marker-assisted introgression. © Copyright © 2020 Berny Mier y Teran, Konzen, Palkovic, Tsai and Gepts.

The time-resolved X-ray fluorescence showed that plants absorbed ca. 10-fold more Zn from ZnSO4 (aq) than from Zn-EDTA (aq). However, the uptake velocity did not influence the amount of Zn in the stem. It let furthermore appear that the plants were able to reduce the absorption of Zn from Zn-EDTA (aq) earlier than ZnSO4 (aq). Thus, the entrance of Zn2+ into the roots is not necessarily accompanied by SO4 2− (aq). Regardless the source, the Zn distribution and its transport in the stem were spatially correlated to the bundles and cortex nearby the epidermal cells. Its chemical speciation showed that Zn is neither transported as ZnSO4(aq) nor as Zn-EDTA(aq), indicating that these compounds are retained in the roots or biotransformed on in the root-solution interface. Zn2+ was long-distance transported complexed by organic molecules such as histidine, malate, and citrate, and the proportion of ligands was affected by the concentration of Zn2+ in the stem rather than by the type of Zn source. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, flowering species that evolved to attract Hymenoptera pollinators are colored by blue anthocyanin-metal complexes. Plants lacking anthocyanins are pigmented by betalains but are unable to produce blue hues. By extending the -system of betalains, we designed a photostable and metal-free blue dye named BeetBlue that did not show toxicity to human hepatic and retinal pigment epithelial cells and does not affect zebrafish embryonal development. This chiral dye can be conveniently synthesized from betalamic acid obtained from hydrolyzed red beetroot juice or by enzymatic oxidation of l-dopa. BeetBlue is blue in the solid form and in solution of acidified polar molecular solvents, including water. Its capacity to dye natural matrices makes BeetBlue the prototype of a new class of low-cost bioinspired chromophores suitable for a myriad of applications requiring a blue hue.

However, little is known about how photodegradation may influence decomposition in other ecosystems not subject to moisture limitations and under what conditions photodegradation may be favored. Decomposition in humid tropical ecosystems is a complex process, and it can be influenced by a number of environmental factors that are distinct from arid and semi-arid ecosystems. To assess the mechanisms underlying photodegradation by ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation in a humid tropical ecosystem, we designed a 300-day field experiment in a tropical site in Brazil with high levels of annual precipitation, compared to arid ecosystems, and exposed litter to three levels of radiation (full sun, UV-B removed, and shade) combined with a biocide treatment. Results show that after nearly one year of exposure, the microbial biomass was not affected by UV-B incidence, and this effect has not yet been fully understood for tropical ecosystems. Modeled using an exponential deceleration equation, the removal of UV-B radiation decelerated the plant litter decomposition rate for the control conditions by 21% compared to litter exposed to full sun. Interestingly, shaded litter exhibited similar mass loss compared to litter exposed to full sun. Furthermore, differences in the decay constant among radiation treatments due to the UV-B effect were independent of lignin loss. Overall, our study suggests that UV-B radiation contributed to plant litter decomposition through carbon losses but had no discernible effect on nitrogen, lignin, or cellulose loss specifically. Importantly, our results demonstrate that photodegradation occurs under humid tropical conditions, and further studies are necessary to examine the mechanisms of carbon loss. © 2020	Article	Scopus

The official method for the determination of specific esters in cachaça is based on gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector, whereas a volumetric procedure is recommended for determining the total content. Because of the high analytical demand, faster and more practical analytical procedures are required for quality control of the product. The aim of this work was to develop a spot test exploiting smartphone-based digital images for in situ determination of total esters in cachaça. The procedure was based on the reaction of the analytes with hydroxylamine, generating the corresponding hydroxamate ions, which form violet complexes with Fe(iii) in an acidic medium. Digital images were acquired under controlled illumination and converted to RGB values using the PhotoMetrix® 1.8 application. The values of channel B were taken as the analytical response because of the complementarity with the color of the reaction product. A linear response was obtained within 100-500 mg L-1 ethyl acetate, with the coefficient of variation (n = 10) and limit of detection (99.7% confidence level) estimated at 1.1% and 30 mg L-1 ethyl acetate, respectively. The procedure consumes only 1.4 mg NH2OH·HCl and 115 µg Fe(iii) and generates only 900 µL of waste per determination. The results of the proposed procedure agreed with those obtained by the reference volumetric method at the 95% confidence level. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.	Article	Scopus

To this end, nine polymeric films 1.5 to 7.6 μm thick with different composition were used for calibration and validation purposes. The univariate approach was not suitable as thickness measurement strategy, because the coefficient of determination (R2) between the Rh-Kα Compton (18.54–19.83 keV) counting rate and the thin film thickness was estimated as 0.873 (n = 9). Even lower R2 values were estimated for other X-ray spectral regions. On the other hand, the multivariate approach proved to be appropriated for the polymeric thin film thickness measurement, presenting satisfactory R2 values (0.993–0.998; n = 8), precision (4%) and recovery (97%). The scanning electron microscopy was employed for validation of the proposed multivariate strategy. One can concluded that we show that the energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence using multivariate approach is a powerful non-destructive tool to measure the polymeric thin film thickness. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Questions remain as to the origin of the Cerrado, a highly endangered biome, and other types of vegetation, such as the Capões – small vegetation islands of semi-deciduous and mountain forests. We investigated the factors that influenced the expansion and contraction of the Cerrado and Capões during the late Quaternary (last ~35 ka), using a multi-proxy approach: stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N), geochemistry, pollen and multivariate statistics derived from a peat core (Pinheiro mire, Serra do Espinhaço Meridional). Five major shifts in precipitation, temperature, vegetation and landscape stability occurred at different timescales. Our study revealed that changes in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) seem to have been coeval with these shifts: from the Late Glacial Maximum to mid-Holocene the SACZ remained near (~29.6 to ~16.5k cal a bp) and over (~16.5 to ~6.1 k cal a bp) the study area, providing humidity to the region. This challenges previous research which suggested that climate was drier for this time period. At present, the Capões are likely to be a remnant of a more humid climate; meanwhile, the Cerrado biome seems to have stablished in the late Holocene, after ~3.1 k cal a bp. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

It is likely that land uses and management practices, particularly fertilizer use have affected phosphorus (P) distribution and availability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of land-use types (native forest and maize mono-cropping), and the related P addition, on the forms and distribution of soil P and their isotopic exchangeability. An Andisol, sampled from a cropping site, along with the contiguous area under native forest was treated with 32P-labelled potassium phosphate (KH2 32PO4). The soil samples were extracted after incubation times of 7, 21, 35 and 49 days. Phosphorus content and 32P recovery in fractions sequentially extracted were assessed for each incubation time. Total soil P was dominated by inorganic fractions (79 to 86%) in both land-use types. Resin-Pi, bicarbonate extractable inorganic P (Bic-Pi) and sodium hydroxide extractable inorganic P (NaOH0.1-Pi) were all raised with P addition. However, the proportion of organic P fraction was reduced under cropped soil. The recovery of 32P in soils with P addition indicates that resin-Pi, Bic-Pi and NaOH0.1-Pi comprised nearly all the exchangeable P. In native soils with no P addition, more than 19% of the 32P was recovered in Bic-Po and NaOH0.1-Po forms. This finding indicates that organic P cycling is crucial when soil Pi reserves are presented in an inadequate amount. Ecologically based management has to be designed for replenishment and succeeding maintenance of soil organic P compounds to increase sustainable agricultural production. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science	Article	Scopus

An adequate availability of water and nutrients, especially nitrogen (N), is of utmost importance. From the hypothesis that the source and the rate of N fertilization influence the N use efficiency of an irrigated soil–sugarcane system, this study aimed to evaluate the stalk and crop residues (pointer and leaves) yield, as well as the N utilization, from different rates of ammonium nitrate and urea by irrigated sugarcane in the cane plant cycle, using an15N isotopic dilution technique. The soil used for the experiment was an Oxisol (Rhodic Haplustox) Cerrado (savannah) phase. The experiment was carried out at a farm of the Raízen Mill, which was located in the municipality of Jataí, Goias State, Brazil. The sugarcane variety IACSP95–5000 was used in a randomized block design, with three replicates, four N rates (30, 60, 120, and 180 kg ha−1), and two fertilizer sources labeled with15N isotopes (urea and ammonium nitrate). The average value for N utilization was 60.17% for the ammonium nitrate source and 44.95% for urea. The responses in the percentage and quantity of N in the sugarcane from the fertilizer increase with the increasing N rate. The soil was the main N source for sugarcane. The higher stalk and pointer yield was recorded at the average rate of 143.61 kg N ha−1 . Further studies are needed to evaluate the residual effect of N in the next cycles. © 2020 by the authors.

The objective of this study was to verify the effects of organic materials derived from the sugarcane cultivation system on the mineralization and degradation of aminocyclopyrachlor in the soil. 14C-aminocyclopyrachlor was applied to soil with organic residues (sugarcane straw, filter cake and vinasse) and evaluated for 112 days of incubation. Mineralization was quantified by the weekly evolution of 14CO2, and the extracted, bound residues and the formation of metabolites of aminocyclopyrachlor were quantified. The mineralization was lower than 45% in all treatments. The degradation half-life (DT50) is being 187 days for unamended soil and > 240 days for soils amended with organic materials. For 90% of the herbicide to be degraded (DT90), between 622 and 921 days was required in all soils. Bound residues were formed in the soil (30% of the total applied in all treatments). No metabolites were formed during the whole incubation period, regardless of the treatment. The presence of organic materials in the soil increased the persistence of aminocyclopyrachlor in the soil, so that persistence of the herbicide may promote a residual effect on weeds and carryover in subsequent crops. © 2019, Society for Sugar Research & Promotion.

However, since these environments present highly heterogeneous physicochemical properties, including contaminants that hinder nucleic acids isolation and downstream techniques, the development of best molecular practices is crucial. This work aimed to optimize standard protocols for DNA extraction and gene quantification by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) based on natural and anthropogenic soils and sediments (primary forest, pasture, Amazonian Dark Earth, and várzea, a seasonally flooded area) of the Eastern Amazon. Our modified extraction protocol increased the fluorometric DNA concentration by 48%, reaching twice the original amount for most of the pasture and várzea samples, and the 260/280 purity ratio by 15% to values between 1.8 to 2.0, considered ideal for DNA. The addition of bovine serum albumin in the qPCR reaction improved the quantification of the 16S rRNA genes of Archaea and Bacteria and its precision among technical replicates, as well as allowed their detection in previously non-amplifiable samples. It is concluded that the changes made in the protocols improved the parameters of the DNA samples and their amplification, thus increasing the reliability of microbial communities’ analysis and its ecological interpretations. © 2020; Microbial Ecology; Soil Science; Soil Biology; Biodiversity; Microbiology; Bacteria; Microbial Genomics; Microorganism; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Molecular Biology; Amazonian soils; DNA extraction; Quantitative real-time PCR.; Archaeal communities; bacterial communities. © 2020	Article	Scopus

The Podzols of tropical regions contain important information on climate and vegetation changes that occurred mainly in late Pleistocene and Holocene; however few studied, regarding their spatial variation, that can be investigated through ground penetrating radar (GPR). The aim was to study morphological, physical, chemical, stable C isotopic properties and spatial distribution of soils within depressions of the Barreiras Formation and characterize the 14C chronology of two Podzols and their B spodic horizons, along a transect grassland to forest in northeastern Espírito Santo State, Brazil. The profiles encompass a sequence of A-E-Bhm horizons, except for P3 and P6 with histic H and A-Bt, respectively. The GPR images showed patterns corresponding to these soil horizons, and the GPR data reveal the presence of diagnostic subsurface horizons characteristic of spodic horizons with cemented layers. The influence of relief factors and original materials was observed, associated with ferrolysis and podzolisation as main actors in the genesis of soils studied. The monomorphic organic matter filling the voids evidences the processes of immobilization, illuviation and precipitation, with the genesis of the spodic horizon. The Podzols profiles of Pleistocene organic matter ages accumulated compounds of C3 plants from the vegetation cover in the B spodic horizons of the profiles P4 and P1, since at least 14,251 and 38,890 cal BP, respectively, suggesting the dominance of a humid climate at least during the studied period in the region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

The binary search approach was implemented in a flow-batch analyzer, in order to add the in-line selected titrant (e.g. copper ions) volumes to the sample. When the titration end-point was surpassed, the free metal ions catalyzed the reaction of luminol with hydrogen peroxide, yielding the chemiluminescence, which was quantified even in solutions of high opacity. Accuracy was assessed through addition/recovery tests involving classical complexing species (EDTA, DTPA and DTTC), and recoveries ranged from 96% to 115%. The proposed system requires low amounts of reagents and samples (0.42 mg of luminol, 82 μg H2O2, 1.10 mL of sample) per titration run, meaning ca. 12 mL of effluent per titration, and yields precise results (5% r.s.d.) at a sampling throughput of 43 h−1. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In past 2 decades, many investigations have focused on studying effects of antibiotics on ruminal fermentation, however, European Union has banned the use antibiotics in animal feeds due to human food safety. Therefore, using plant extracts containing a high level of plant secondary metabolites (PSM) can be an alternative for improving animal performance without compromising food security issues. Most of the plant extracts contains PSM that can be serve as natural resource for animal production systems, nevertheless it is largely unexploited as it is considered as anti-nutritional factors. However, in recent years, various studies emphasized that a group of PSM (e.g. tannins, essential oil and saponins) has ability to manipulate rumen fermentation in a favorable way, thus can be used as natural alternatives for improving ruminant production systems. However, the role of PSM still remains unclear due to limited data and need to be more fully exploited to better understand their properties as bioactive compounds. The present review will discuss the use of plant secondary metabolites in rumen metabolism in terms of biochemical and physiological performance on ruminant production systems, covering topics on proven effectiveness, consumer acceptance, environment, animal safety and welfare. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

To address the large rising edge error in estimations performed using a genetic algorithm (GA), a differential evolution (DE) was used in this study. As a result, the estimated time was reduced to about 1/10 that obtained with GA, and the evaluation value indicating the difference between the measured value and the estimated value was reduced to about 1/2. Thus, it was possible to estimate with higher accuracy by using DE. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.	Conference paper	Scopus

Different studies have used this technique to investigate distribution and concentration of essential and deleterious elements in vegetation. Special emphasis has been recently placed on the key aspects concerning sampling processes, laboratory protocols and calibration methods for quantitative analysis. The aim of the present study was to develop a quantitative methodology to determine the nutrient content in Pinus taeda tree-rings by XRF. Using a 1 mm X-ray excitation beam from a Rh X-ray tube at 30 kV and 600 μA, and dwell time of 20 s, we present calibration curves for P, S, K, Ca, Mn and Fe based on multi-elemental standard addition using wood matrix of 17-year-old Pinus taeda trees. Satisfactory recoveries of our XRF approach for Ca, P, Mn, S and K (<115%), and tolerable for Fe (123%) were obtained compared to inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry results. The non-destructive and quantitative XRF method allows assessing annual element concentrations of P. taeda trees, in order to provide tools for monitoring the nutrient dynamic in an experimental plantation. Furthermore, a method for elemental quantification based on multi-elemental standard addition using wood matrix is described as a useful procedure for future applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In turn, dispersal agents are affected by landscape composition and configuration. Understanding the effects of anthropization on pollen and seed dispersal in natural environments is crucial to developing long-term strategies for in situ and ex situ conservation of Neotropical savanna tree species. Here, we evaluated the genotypic and genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure (SGS), and pollen and seed dispersal of the endangered tree species Hymenaea stigonocarpa in a 2200-ha plot established in a strongly fragmented savanna landscape in Brazil. A total of 157 individuals were identified, 66 juveniles and 91 adults. Height, root-collar diameter for juveniles and diameter at breast height for adults were determined for each individual, and leaves were sampled to be used in genotyping by microsatellites. Genotypic diversity (R) was similarly high in adults (0.87) and juveniles (0.80), indicating more sexual reproduction than clonal. Heterozygosities were also similar between both generations, and no inbreeding was detected. Adults and juveniles present SGS, but the extent measured by the Sp-statistic was not significant. Both pollen and seed flow were elevated (24.2%) and reached long distances (3778 m and 3914 m, respectively) within the sampled area, but the pattern was not fat-tailed, indicating that most dispersal was over shorter distances. We conclude that fragmentation does not reproductively isolate the sampled population because individuals located outside the area may serve as sources of gene flow between remnant forest patches; however, the probability of dispersal over long distances is reduced. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

Our hypothesis is that this stimulus depends on genotype and N availability for sugarcane. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the Mo fertilization on BNF, NTA, δ15N and the accumulation of N in different genotypes (RB867515 and RB92579) of sugarcane fertilized with N. The cultivars were subjected to two rates of N fertilization (without N fertilization and 60 kg ha−1) and two rates of Mo fertilization (without Mo fertilization and 200 g ha−1). NTA, δ15N and BNF were evaluated throughout the cycle of the sugarcane. Both leaf and root NTA was maximal at approximately 100 DAP. Mo fertilization stimulated NTA in RB867515 but reduced in RB92579. The bacteria associated with the sugarcane fixed atmospheric-N2 and the Mo fertilization stimulated this fixation, especially without N fertilization. Mo fertilization promoted greater N accumulation and should be encouraged for fertility management, especially in soils with low N content or as an alternative for reducing the use of N fertilizers in sugarcane. © 2019, Society for Sugar Research & Promotion.

AMP can be inhibited by linear pentapeptides isolated from Microcystis aeruginosa LTPNA08 (MG7XX). Porcine AMP inhibition-a model for human AMP-activity was spectrophotometrically measured by the formation of p-nitroanilide from L-leucine-p-nitroanilide substrate by AMP. AMP inhibition by MG770 exhibited comparable inhibition levels to amastatin (IC50 values: 1.20 ± 0.1 μM and 0.98 ± 0.1 μM, respectively), while MG756 was slightly less potent (with IC50 values of 3.26 ± 0.5 μM). Molecular modelling suggests a potential binding mode, based on the interaction with the Zn2+ cofactor, where MG7700s extra methyl group contributes to the disturbance of the Zn2+ cofactor complex and highlights the importance of hydrophobicity for the site. © 2019 by the authors.

These different characteristics can influence the bacterial community inhabiting the rhizosphere niche that, in turn, influences plant growth and health. In this study, the bacterial community dynamics in the rhizosphere of maize and cowpea, in subsequent cultivation, were assessed using the 16S rRNA sequencing. Thus, during maize growth, soils were collected at 45 (flowering) and 75 (senescence) days. Afterward, during cowpea growth, the sampling occurred at 35 (flowering) and 65 (senescence) days. Our results showed differences between developmental stages within the same plant species. For maize, Acidobacteria decreased from flowering to senescence; while for cowpea, Proteobacteria, Armatimonadetes, WPS-2, and OP11 increased from flowering to senescence. Comparing the same developmental stage for both plant species, Proteobacteria, Elusimicrobia, WPS-2 decreased from maize flowering to cowpea flowering; while for the senescence stage, Acidobacteria, Armatimonadetes, and OP11 increased from maize to cowpea. Also, the rhizosphere community dynamic was more complex at the senescence stage compared to the flowering stage and bulk soil for both plants species. The results showed that the structure and diversity of bacterial community vary significantly according to plant species and, in a minor extent, their developmental stage. Also, we showed that the variation in rhizosphere activity during the plant growth could drive the responses of the bacterial community. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the dietary effects of replacing corn bran with banana leftovers on performance, carcass, non-carcass components, meat traits, and fatty acid profile of Santa Inês lambs. Twenty-four Santa Inês female lambs with an average weight of 23.73 kg were fed diets containing 60% coast cross hay and 40% concentrate (30% corn bran and 10% soybean meal). Treatments consisted of corn bran replaced by banana leftovers at rates of 0, 25, 50, and 75% on a dry matter basis. The experiment lasted 120 days. Animals were slaughtered and carcasses and non-carcass components were evaluated. The half-carcasses were weighed and sectioned into commercial cuts. The 12th and 13th ribs were dissected to collect bones, muscle and fat proportions. Cooking loss, color, shear force and sarcomere length were measured. Fatty acid profiles were obtained by gas chromatography. Hot and cold carcass weight, leg, neck, lung, loin eye area, fat thickness, initial sample weight of the 12th and 13th ribs, fat and bone, presented a negative linear effect of banana leftovers replacing corn in the diet. Loin, fat thickness, cooking loss and carcass redness showed a negative quadratic effect, while full and empty abomasum, full omasum, sarcomere length and yellowness presented a positive quadratic effect. Replacement of up to 75% of corn bran by banana leftovers did not interfere in the intake, performance, meat traits and the fatty acid profile of lambs. The use of banana leftovers may be an alternative for reducing animal production costs. © 2020, Scientia Agricola. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

Using 90 inventory plots across intact, lowland, terra firme, Amazonian forests and a new phylogeny including 526 angiosperm genera, we investigated the association between taxonomic and evolutionary metrics of diversity and two key measures of ecosystem function: aboveground wood productivity and biomass storage. While taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity were not important predictors of variation in biomass, both emerged as independent predictors of wood productivity. Amazon forests that contain greater evolutionary diversity and a higher proportion of rare species have higher productivity. While climatic and edaphic variables are together the strongest predictors of productivity, our results show that the evolutionary diversity of tree species in diverse forest stands also influences productivity. As our models accounted for wood density and tree size, they also suggest that additional, unstudied, evolutionarily correlated traits have significant effects on ecosystem function in tropical forests. Overall, our pan-Amazonian analysis shows that greater phylogenetic diversity translates into higher levels of ecosystem function: tropical forest communities with more distantly related taxa have greater wood productivity. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

This study performed time resolved experiments to probe Zn uptake, biotransformation and physiological effects on Phaseolus vulgaris (L.). Plants roots were exposed to ZnO nanoparticles (40 and 300 nm) dispersions and ZnSO4(aq) (100 and 1000 mg Zn L−1) for 48 h. Near edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed that 40 nm ZnO was more easily dissolved by roots than 300 nm ZnO. It also showed that in the leaves Zn was found as a mixture Zn3(PO4)2 and Zn-histidine complex. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy showed that root-to-shoot Zn-translocation presented a decreasing gradient of concentration and velocity, it seems radial Zn movement occurs simultaneously to the axial xylem transport. Below 100 mg Zn L−1, the lower stem tissue section served as a buffer preventing Zn from reaching the leaves. Conversely, it was not observed for 1000 mg Zn L−1 ZnSO4(aq). Transcriptional analysis of genes encoding metal carriers indicated higher expression levels of tonoplast-localized transporters, suggesting that the mechanism trend to accumulate Zn in the lower tissues may be associated with an enhanced of Zn compartmentalization in vacuoles. The photosynthetic rate, transpiration, and water conductance were impaired by treatments. © 2019, The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

Our main goal was to develop a robust habitat suitability model of Amazon-nut and to identify the most important predictor variables to support conservation and tree planting decisions. Localization: Amazon region, South America. Methods: We collected 3,325 unique Amazon-nut records and assembled >100 spatial predictor variables organized across climatic, edaphic, and geophysical categories. We compared suitability models using variables (a) selected through statistical techniques; (b) recommended by experts; and (c) integrating both approaches (a and b). We applied different spatial filtering scenarios to reduce overfitting. We additionally fine-tuned MAXENT settings to our data. The best model was selected through quantitative and qualitative assessments. Results: Principal component analysis based on expert recommendations was the most appropriate method for predictor selection. Elevation, coarse soil fragments, clay, slope, and annual potential evapotranspiration were the most important predictors. Their relative contribution to the best model amounted to 75%. Filtering of the presences within a radius of 10 km displayed lowest overfitting, a satisfactory omission rate and the most symmetric distribution curve. Our findings suggest that under current environmental conditions, suitable habitat for Amazon-nut is found across 2.3 million km2, that is, 32% of the Amazon Biome. Main conclusion: The combination of statistical techniques with expert knowledge improved the quality of our suitability model. Topographic and soil variables were the most important predictors. The combination of predictor variable selection, fine-tuning of model parameters and spatial filtering was critical for the construction of a reliable habitat suitability model. © 2019 The Authors.

Palynological studies with several representatives of the genus are scarce. The purpose of this study was to describe the pollen morphology of Microstachys and find possible differentiating characteristics between its species. Ten species of the genus were analysed, represented by 21 herbarium collections. Their pollen grains were acetolysed, measured and photographed under light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The analysed species possess pollen in monads, of small to medium size, isopolars, amb distincticly trilobed, oblate-spheroidal, prolate-spheroidal or subprolate, tricolporate with narrow and very long colpi, almost fused at the poles sometimes forming an invagination with tapering ends and margo of the colporus wide to very wide and psilate; endoapertures lalongate to very lalongate with tapering ends, presence of a narrow costae distinct in the endoaperture; exine microreticulate homobrochate, walls with simple columella; at the mesocolpus the sexine separates from the nexine forming cavea; and sexine always thicker than the nexine. Microstachys is a stenopalynous genus, despite its species varying in pollen size, shape and width of the cavea, margo of the colporus, and length of the endoapertures, demonstrating taxonomic value, and indicating a contribution towards future systematic analyses. © 2019, © 2019 Collegium Palynologicum Scandinavicum.

It is considered an element that slightly absorbed by plants, so that the application of high doses to the soil could increase the absorption of 137Cs, which is desired for the remediation of contaminated soils. There is shortage of knowledge on remediation of tropical and subtropical soils contaminated with 137Cs. The aim of this work was to evaluate the use of 133Cs for the remediation of Brazilian tropical and subtropical soils contaminated with 137Cs. In addition, we investigated the Cs uptake by bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown in Cs contaminated soil. The experiment was carried out in pots under greenhouse conditions. Seven soil types were used in the experiment (Oxisol, Udox, Psamment, Ochrept; Aquoll; Udox and Udult), which received the application of four doses of 133Cs (0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/pot in a completely randomized design arranged in a factorial scheme (7 soil types x 4 doses of 133Cs) with three replicates. An increase in transfer factor values of 137Cs was observed for both shoot growth and grains, as well as in percentage of total activity of 137Cs removed from the soil regarding to addition of stable cesium levels in all soils. The results showed that psamment soil presented higher specific activity of 137Cs in the soil and grains, as well as for the transfer coefficient from soil to shoot growth and grains. The application of stable cesium chloride to soil did not cause any effects on dry matter production of shoot growth and grains. The addition of 133Cs increased the transfer from soil 137Cs to the plant regardless of soil type, proving the efficiency of this practice for the remediation of soils contaminated with radioactive Cs. In addition, the plants of common bean were efficient for use in phytoremediation. © 2019.	Article	Scopus

Sorption-desorption studies were performed by the batch equilibrium method and biodegradation in biometric bottles using radiolabeled diuron in14C. Freundlich coefficient (Kf) values ranged from 13.50 to 50.41 μmol(1-1/n) L1/n kg-1 in TPI-2 and TPI-1, respectively, indicating very high diuron sorption in anthropogenic soils, following the order: TPI-1 ≥ TPI-2 > NQo (99.10, 98.95 and 60.8%, respectively). Diuron desorption was very low in anthropogenic soils, ranging from 1.36 (TPI-1) to 1.70% (TPI-2), and 24% to NQo. Accumulated diuron mineralization to14C-CO2 was < 3% at 70 days after herbicide application, regardless of the assessed soil. Formation of 35 and 44% residue bound to TPI-2 and TPI-1 was observed, higher than to NQo (17%). In contrast, the residue extracted from NQo varied from 72 to 91%, ranging from 48 to 83% for TPI-1 and TPI-2 during the incubation period. The degradation half-life (DT50) of diuron in anthropogenic soils was of 66.65 and 68.63 days for TPI-1 and TPI-2, respectively, while a period of 88.86 days was observed for NQo. The formation of only one herbicide metabolite in all soils was evidenced. The application of diuron in arable areas in the presence of anthropogenic Amazonian soils may lead to inefficient chemical weed control, since these soils may reduce herbicide soil bioavailability due to high OC contents, where high sorption and low herbicide desorption are noted, as well as faster degradation compared to sandy soil. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira da Ciencia das Plantas Daninha.

Here, we combined metagenomic approach with a large environmental dataset, to (i) identify the microbial assembly patterns and, (ii) to evaluate the ecological processes governing microbial assembly, in bulk soil and soybean rhizosphere, along a long-term forest-to-agriculture conversion chronosequence, in Eastern Amazon. We hypothesized that (i) microbial communities in bulk soil and rhizosphere have different assembly patterns and (ii) the weight of the four ecological processes governing assembly differs between bulk soil and rhizosphere and along the chronosequence in the same fraction. Community assembly in bulk soil fitted most the zero-sum multinomial (ZSM) neutral-based model, regardless of time. Low to intermediate dispersal was observed. Decreasing influence of abiotic factors was counterbalanced by increasing influence of biotic factors, as the chronosequence advanced. Undominated ecological processes of dispersal limitation and variable selection governing community assembly were observed in this soil fraction. For soybean rhizosphere, community assembly fitted most the lognormal niche-based model in all chronosequence areas. High dispersal and an increasing influence of abiotic factors coupled with a decreasing influence of biotic factors were found along the chronosequence. Thus, we found a dominant role of dispersal process governing microbial assembly with a secondary effect of homogeneous selection process, mainly driven by decreasing aluminum and increased cations saturation in soil solution, due to long-term no-till cropping. Together, our results indicate that long-term no-till lead community abundances in bulk soil to be in a transient and conditional state, while for soybean rhizosphere, community abundances reach a periodic and permanent distribution state. Dominant dispersal process in rhizosphere, coupled with homogeneous selection, brings evidences that soybean root system selects microbial taxa via trade-offs in order to keep functional resilience of soil processes. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

The effect of gossypol (a compound present in cotton co-products) in ruminant metabolism and meat quality is not yet clear. This study was undertaken in order to evaluate the effects of cotton co-products in lamb muscle proteome. Twenty-four Santa Inês ram lambs, 5-months old (20.6 ± 1.9 kg), were randomly assigned to four treatments: Control (without cottonseed), whole cottonseed, cottonseed meal and high oil cottonseed meal. At 95 days into the experiment, lambs were slaughtered and samples from Longissimus dorsi were collected. Proteins were extracted and analyzed by 2-D electrophoresis. Spots showing a significant effect from the treatment (the “treatment effect”) and present in more than 90% of the samples were identified using mass spectrometry. Cotton co-products decreased the abundance of aldehyde and malate dehydrogenases, creatine kinase M-type and Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase. They also increased four proteins related to muscle contraction. Thus, feeding cotton co-products to lambs changed the abundance of important muscle proteins. A cotton co-product diet induced a negative impact on the energy supply of muscle cells and, consequently, the abundance of ATP dependent proteins (contractile apparatus) increased, probably in order to offset and maintain muscle function. These proteomic changes can promote our understanding of alterations in the sensorial properties of meat due to cotton co-product diets in further investigations. © 2019, Scientia Agricola.

SA fractionation has been carried out batchwise, which is not compatible with the high analytical demand in agronomical studies and increases susceptibility to analytical errors. In this context, a novel flow-batch sample preparation system for SA fractionation on fresh plant leaves was developed. It was based on microwave-assisted extraction with water and conversion of the conjugated species to free SA by alkaline hydrolysis. Free and total SA were quantified by fluorimetry after separation by sequential injection chromatography in a C18 monolithic column. The proposed procedure is directly applicable to plant leaves containing up 16 mg kg-1 SA, with a limit of detection of 0.1 mg kg-1 of SA, coefficient of variation of 3.0% (n = 10), and sampling rate of 4 samples h-1. The flow-batch sample preparation system was successfully applied to SA fractionation in sugarcane, corn, and soybean leaves without clogging or increasing in backpressure. The proposed approach is simple, less time-consuming, and more environmentally friendly in comparison to batchwise procedures.  © 2020 Thiago L. Marques et al.	Article	Scopus

Commonly, these soil physical properties are represented by equations relating pressure head, soil water content, and hydraulic conductivity. The commonly used empirical equations used for this purpose have a limited range of reliability, not functioning properly in the very dry range. An approach to extend the reliability and applicability of these models has been p hed piecewise equations added to the base model and implying in changes in the base model paramete. We propose a modification of the model commonly known as Peters-Durner-Iden (PDI), extending the reliability of most common base models without the need to change the original parameters. The transformation is analytically equivalent, interchangeable and allows to anchor the retention function at any point instead of the residual water content. The Van Genuchten, Kosugi, Brooks-Corey and Groenevelt equations can easily be combined to the proposed model, which may be used to predict water flow in the dry range where the commonly used equations are not reliable. © 2019 The Authors.

In water-limited ecosystems, annual plants have strategies to synchronize their growth and reproduction to the availability of water. Some species or ecotypes of flowers are early to ensure that their life cycles are completed before the onset of late season terminal drought (“drought escape”). This accelerated flowering correlates with low water-use efficiency (WUE). The molecular players and physiological mechanisms involved in this coordination are not fully understood. We analyzed WUE using gravimetry, gas exchange, and carbon isotope discrimination in florigen deficient (sft mutant), wild-type (Micro-Tom), and florigen over-expressing (SFT-ox) tomato lines. Increased florigen expression led to accelerated flowering time and reduced WUE. The low WUE of SFT-ox was driven by higher stomatal conductance and thinner leaf blades. This florigen-driven effect on WUE appears be independent of abscisic acid (ABA). Our results open a new avenue to increase WUE in crops in an ABA-independent manner. Manipulation of florigen levels could allow us to produce crops with a life cycle synchronized to water availability. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	Article	Scopus

Twenty obese women were prospectively submitted to double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) with gastric juice and biopsy collection, before and 3 months after RYGB. We then evaluated morphological and molecular changes by combining endoscopic and histopathological analyses with an integrated untargeted metabolomics and transcriptomics multiplatform. Preoperatively, 16 women already presented with gastric histopathological alterations and an increased pH (≥4.0). These gastric abnormalities worsened after RYGB. A 90-fold increase in the concentration of bile acids was found in ES fluid, which also contained other metabolites commonly found in the intestinal environment, urine, and faeces. In addition, 135 genes were differentially expressed in ES tissue. Combined analysis of metabolic and gene expression data suggested that RYGB promoted activation of biological processes involved in local inflammation, bacteria overgrowth, and cell proliferation sustained by genes involved in carcinogenesis. Accumulated fluid in the ES appears to behave as a potential premalignant environment due to worsening inflammation and changing gene expression patterns that are favorable to the development of cancer. Considering that ES may remain for the rest of the patient’s life, long-term ES monitoring is therefore recommended for patients undergoing RYGB. © 2019, The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

CRF from peel of Purple tomato contains lutein, lycopene, and β-carotene up to 6, 1.5, and 2.5 times more than that of Red Cherry and it exhibited the highest antioxidant activity at 400 μg/mL, reaching 82% and 97% in DPPH and ABTS•+ assays, respectively. Besides that, the Purple peel showed the highest scavenging lipoperoxides capacity as well as displayed the highest ferric reducing antioxidant power compared to the other CRF. In turn, the Red Cherry pulp CRF showed the highest antiproliferative activity against four tumor cell lines (MCF-7, NCI-H460, HeLa, and HepG2) at non-toxic concentrations. High concentration of neurosporene, and lycopene in Red Cherry pulp CRF show to be related to the good antiproliferative activity found on it. Therefore, this new variety of nutrient-rich purple tomato could be explored as well as the commercial variety Red Cherry, since both are good sources of dietary carotenoids with health-promoting properties. © 2019 The Authors; Food Science; Antioxidant; Phenolic Compound; Food Component Analysis; Chemical Composition of Food; Chemical Characterization of Food; Food Biochemistry; Lycopene; Carotene; Hepatotoxicity; Antiproliferative activity; Solanum lycopersicum L. © 2019 The Authors	Article	Scopus

This research evaluated the transfer of cerium oxide (nano-CeO2) nanoparticles in a terrestrial trophic chain formed by the producer Nicandra physaloides (L.) Gaertn. (Solanaceae) and a primary consumer, green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), a generalist insect pest. Nicandra physaloides plants were treated by foliar spraying with nano-CeO2 (25 nm) aqueous suspensions (1, 10, 100, and 1,000 mg Ce L-1) and fed to the green peach aphid (M. persicae). The survival and fecundity of insects were evaluated. Microprobe X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy was used to verify the presence of Ce in plants and insects. It was possible to verify Ce in the oral cavity and digestive system of aphids fed on leaves previously treated with nano-CeO2 (1,000 mg CeL-1). Despite the transfer of Ce in this terrestrial trophic chain, the nanoparticles did not reduce survival and fecundity of aphids. © 2019 Florida Entomological Society. All rights reserved.

In a completely randomized design, 20 bunkers of corn silage, each from a different farm, were used for data collection. Using a coring machine, 5 samples of silage were extracted from an exposed face of each silo and samples were analyzed for density of compaction, plus concentrations of DM, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), total digestible nutrients (TDN), total carbohydrate (TC), non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) and starch (STA), as well as electrical conductivity. There was significant variation in many of the parameters measured with the greatest variation in density on a natural matter basis. Negative correlations were observed between percentages of DM, NDF and ADF in the silage and silage density on a natural matter basis (P<0.05). On the other hand, DM% was positively correlated with concentrations of STA, TDN and TC (P<0.05). Density on a DM basis showed positive correlation with STA but was negatively correlated with NDF and ADF (P<0.05) indicating that the more fibrous material is harder to compact. A technology transfer program seems warranted to inform Brazilian farmers of these findings and the importance of harvesting forage at a stage of growth when quality would be better to increase the probability of achieving adequate compaction of the ensiled material and hence better quality of material at feeding out. © 2020.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the relief on SOM fractions, considering their distribution in different topographic positions, segments, in two pedoforms (concave and convex) in areas covered with forest in the Atlantic Forest biome. The two pedoforms were selected in adjacent areas and divided into segments considering the topographic variation. The carbon and nitrogen origins were evaluated in the extract up to 100 cm of depth. Soil samples from the 0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm layers were collected for chemical characterization and fractioning (granulometric and chemical) of the SOM. The soil density in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm layers was determined to calculated the carbon stocks. The isotopic composition showed predominance of 13C. The highest organic carbon and particulate carbon contents were found in the convex pedoform. The distribution of humic fractions showed that the larger part of the humidified carbon was in the humin fraction. The humin and fulvic acid fractions were higher in the convex pedoform. The carbon stocks were, in general, higher in the convex pedoform, decreasing as the soil depth increased; and nitrogen stocks presented no differences. The higher carbon and nitrogen contents were found in the convex pedoform and in the lower region of the concave pedoform. © 2020. Floresta. All Rights Reserved.	Article	Scopus

Nevertheless, the studies are focused only on some species of this family. In this sense, we aimed to quantify the bioactive compounds present in the pulps of cambuci, feijoa, uvaia and grumixama; to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant capacity of each one and to correlate the contribution of these bioactive compounds with the antioxidant activity of each fruit pulp. For this, the compounds ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and flavonoids were quantified for the pulps of cambuci, feijoa, uvaia, and grumixama, as well as the in vitro antioxidant capacity by the methods DPPH and ABTS. The results were evaluated by multivariate statistical techniques. The pulps present good antioxidant potential, the one from cambuci presented the highest values for antioxidant activity given by the method DPPH (61.86 μg of Trolox g-1), that from uvaia was prominent by the presence of ascorbic acid (85.40 ascorbic acid 100 g-1) and that from feijoa, by the flavonoid contents (62.45 mg quercetin g-1) and phenolic compounds (10.21 mg gallic acid equivalent g–1). A correlation was observed between pulp antioxidant capacity and the contents of ascorbic acid and carotenoids; on the other hand, the phenolic compounds and flavonoids little contributed for the anti-free radical activity of the methods DPPH and ABTS. © 2020, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

Here, we used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios to establish differences in isotopic niche width and food resource use between forest fragments and the continuous forest for the phyllostomid frugivorous bat Artibeus lituratus. Using mist nests, we captured bats from two forest fragments and two sites in continuous forest, and sampled from each individual captured three body tissues with contrasting turnover rates (skin, muscle, and liver). Samples were collected between February and March (austral summer) and between August and September (austral winter). In addition, in each sampling site and season we collected potential food resources (fruits and insects) consumed by our A. lituratus. Our findings indicate that A. lituratus had a predominantly omnivorous diet, with high consumption of insects during summer in forest fragments. The increasing consumption of insects in these fragments seems to have led to a wider isotopic niche, in relation to the continuous forest. Because A. lituratus is typically a seed disperser, changes in trophic habits in the forest fragments from frugivory to insectivory may diminish their role in forest regeneration.

Selenium (Se) is non essential for plants, however it can improve plant growth and reduce the adverse effects of abiotic stress. In addition, ethylene may interplay the positive effects of Se in plants. In order to investigate the role of ethylene in Se-modulation of antioxidant defence system in response to Cd-stress, we tested the hormonal mutant Epinastic (epi) with a subset of constitutive activation of the ethylene response and Micro-Tom (MT) plants. For this purpose, Se mineral uptake, Cd and Se concentrations, pigments, malondialdeyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents, ethylene production, glutathione (GSH) compound, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were analysed in MT and epi plants submitted to 0.5 mM CdCl2 and 1 μM of selenate or selenite. MT plants treated with both Se forms increased growth in the presence or not of 0.5 mM CdCl2, but not change epi growth. Both Se forms reduced Cd uptake in MT plants and cause reverse effect in epi plants. P, Mg, S, K and Zn uptake increased in epi plants with Se application, irrespective to Cd exposure. Chlorophylls and carotenoids contents decreased in both genotypes under Cd exposure, in contrast to what was observed in epi leaves in the presence of Se. When antioxidant enzymes activities were concerned, Se application increased Mn-SOD, Fe-SOD and APX activities. In the presence of Cd, MT and epi plants exhibited decreased SOD activity and increased CAT, APX and GR activities. MT and epi plants with Se supply exhibited increased APX and GR activities in the presence of Cd. Overall, these results suggest that ethylene may be involved in Se induced-defence responses, that triggers a positive response of the antioxidant system and improve growth under Cd stress. These results showed integrative roles of ethylene and Se in regulating the cell responses to stressful-conditions and, the cross-tolerance to stress could be used to manipulate ethylene regulated gene expression to induce heavy metal tolerance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Alternatively, flow approaches have been proposed to circumvent these issues on solid sample preparation prior to elemental determination by spectroanalytical methods. However, this is not a simple task because solids may cause clogging and increase backpressure on the sample introduction system, whereas proper sample processing conditions are required to achieve reliable results. We critically discuss here tailored flow-based sample preparation systems reported on the literature for performing extraction and digestion procedures. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.	Review	Scopus

This work aimed to assess the performance of a pXRF sensor to predict exchangeable nutrients in soil samples by using two contrasting strategies of sample preparation: pressed pellets and loose powder (<2 mm). Pellets were prepared using soil and a cellulose binder at 10% w w−1 followed by grinding for 20 min. Sample homogeneity was probed by X-ray fluorescence microanalysis. Exchangeable nutrients were assessed by pXRF furnished with a Rh X-ray tube and silicon drift detector. The calibration models were obtained using 58 soil samples and leave-one-out cross-validation. The predictive capabilities of the models were appropriate for both exchangeable K (ex-K) and Ca (ex-Ca) determinations with R2 ≥ 0.76 and RPIQ > 2.5. Although XRF analysis of pressed pellets allowed a slight gain in performance over loose powder samples for the prediction of ex-K and ex-Ca, satisfactory performances were also obtained with loose powders, which require minimal sample preparation. The prediction models with local samples showed promising results and encourage more detailed investigations for the application of pXRF in tropical soils. © 2019 by the authors.

Animals were fed with hay, concentrate and supplemented with Acacia mearnsii (A. mearnsii). The animals were divided into four treatments: two control groups without infection, either receiving A. mearnsii (C+) or not (C-), and two infected groups, one with A. mearnsii (I+) and another without A. mearnsii (I-). Ruminal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and metagenome sequencing of ruminal microbiota were used to evaluate the effect of tannin and infection on ruminal microbiome. For SCFA, differences were observed only with A. mearnsii. Total SCFA and acetate molar percentage were decreased in C+ and I+ (P<0.05). Butyrate, valerate and isovalerate were higher in lambs that received A. mearnsii in the diet (P<0.05). The infection changed the microbiome structure and decreased the abundance of butyrate-producing microorganisms. In addition, A. mearnsii supplementation also affected the structure the microbial community, increasing the diversity and abundance of the butyrate-producing and probiotics bacteria, amino acid metabolic pathways, purine, pyrimidine and sphingolipid metabolism. Together, our findings indicate that A. mearnsii supplementation modulates important groups related to nitrogen, amino acid, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, in rumen microbiome, affected by gastrointestinal nematodes infection in lambs. © FEMS 2020.

Among these stresses, drought is one of the main factors limiting crop productivity and its impact is likely to increase under current scenarios of global climate change. We sought to determine to what extent wild common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) exhibited adaptation to drought stress, whether this potential adaptation is dependent on the climatic conditions of the location of origin of individual populations, and to what extent domesticated common bean reflects potential drought adaptation. • Methods An extensive and diverse set of wild beans from across Mesoamerica, along with a set of reference Mesoamerican domesticated cultivars, were evaluated for root and shoot traits related to drought adaptation. A water deficit experiment was conducted by growing each genotype in a long transparent tube in greenhouse conditions so that root growth, in addition to shoot growth, could be monitored. • Results Phenotypic and landscape genomic analyses, based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms, suggested that beans originating from central and north-west Mexico and Oaxaca, in the driest parts of their distribution, produced more biomass and were deeper-rooted. Nevertheless, deeper rooting was correlated with less root biomass production relative to total biomass. Compared with wild types, domesticated types showed a stronger reduction and delay in growth and development in response to drought stress. Specific genomic regions were associated with root depth, biomass productivity and drought response, some of which showed signals of selection and were previously related to productivity and drought tolerance. • Conclusions The drought tolerance of wild beans consists in its stronger ability, compared with domesticated types, to continue growth in spite of water-limited conditions. This study is the first to relate bean response to drought to environment of origin for a diverse selection of wild beans. It provides information that needs to be corroborated in crosses between wild and domesticated beans to make it applicable to breeding programmes. © The Author(s) 2018.

Methods: A field trial was conducted using five Se rates (12, 21, 38, 68, and 120 g ha−1). Physiologic and enzymatic evaluations were carried out in rice leaves. Rice grain yield and Se contents were assessed. Spatial distributions of Se and other elements were visualized mapping the biofortified rice grains with μXRF at Brazilian Synchrotron Light Source. Results: Results showed that soil Se application was effective in producing rice grains with higher Se contents, yet no effects were verified on rice yield. Antioxidant enzyme activities and gas exchanges in rice leaves changed following the application of Se. The spatial distribution of different elements in biofortified grains varied, with Se being accumulated mainly in the rice endosperm. Conclusion: Our results suggest that soil application of 47 and 36 g ha−1 of Se (as sodium selenate) may guarantee the production of rice grains with adequate Se levels for human consumption in Brazil and worldwide, respectively. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

A useful methodology to quantify the above-ground (ABG) biomass, and consequently, the carbon stocks, in this green infrastructure is the allometric models made for tropical areas. This work aimed to evaluate the carbon stock in public squares within the central region of São Paulo city, thus contributing to the comprehension of São Paulo’s green infrastructure. To test the models, tree density and ABG biomass of approximately 7 ha of urban green areas in the center of São Paulo city were evaluated. The activities involved measuring the diameter at breast height (DBH) of the trees and the total height of all individuals with a DBH greater than 5 cm. The results showed that the public squares varied in size and number of trees. The average height of trees also varied along the squares, probably influencing the ABG biomass allocation. Also, the results showed that there was a considerable variation between the ABG biomass estimated along the models. Some squares stood out in absolute terms of ABG biomass accumulation. The size of the green area correlated only with the total number of individuals found (R2=0.44). The total ABG biomass, tree density, and ABG biomass density did not present a significant relationship with the size of the squares. This work demonstrates, for the first time, the attributes of tree communities in public squares of-São Paulo city and provides technical information for the management of public policies related to the protection and maintenance of urban green areas. © 2020, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

Eighteen three-month-old Santa Ines castrated male lambs (16.9 ± 1.43 kg of body weight) were randomly distributed in two experimental treatments: infected with T. colubriformis (I, n = 9) and uninfected (U, n = 9). The I group received a total of 45,000 L3 larvae of T. colubriformis (5,000 infective larvae, three times per week, for three weeks). During the experimental period, blood, feed digestibility, and nitrogen balance were evaluated. The I lambs showed a reduction in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, and total proteins, as well as an increase in platelets and eosinophils compared to those in the U group (p < 0.05). With the exception of total protein content, these values were within the normal range for the species. Furthermore, lower dry matter and organic matter digestibility were observed in the I lambs (p = 0.08). The present findings highlight that T. colubriformis infection has the potential to impair some hemato-biochemical parameters as well as feed digestibility in lambs, which could affect their productivity. © 2020, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology.

In southern Brazil, millions of sterile flies of the South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus Wiedemann (Dipetra: Tephritidae), will be produced in a mass-rearing facility called MOSCASUL to suppress wild populations from commercial apple orchards. In spite of standard rearing conditions, the quality of pupal batches can be inconsistent due to various factors. The quantification of poor quality material (e.g. empty pupae, dead pupae or larvae) is necessary to track down rearing issues, and pupal samples must be taken randomly and evaluated individually. To speed up the inspection of pupal samples by replacing the manual testing with the mechanized one, this study assessed a multispectral imaging (MSI) system to distinguish the variations in quality of A. fraterculus pupae and to quantify the variations based on reflectance patterns. Image acquisition and analyses were performed by the VideometerLab4 system on 7-d-old pupae by using 19 wavelengths ranging from 375 to 970 nm. The image representing the near infrared wavelength of 880 nm clearly distinguished among high-quality pupae and the other four classes (i.e. low-quality pupae, empty pupae, dead pupae and larvae). The blind validation test indicated that the MSI system can classify the fruit fly pupae with high accuracy. Therefore, MSI-based classification of A. fraterculus pupae can be used for future pupal quality assessments of fruit flies in mass-rearing facilities. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH	Article	Scopus

The procedure was based on formation of a violet complex between Fe(III) and the hydroxamate ion generated by the reaction of the alkyl esters characteristic of biodiesel with hydroxylamine. The analytical measurements were based on digital images acquired using a smartphone camera and converted to RGB values using a free application software (PhotoMetrix® 1.6). Values of the G channel corresponding to the intensities of the reflected radiation were taken as analytical parameter because of the complementarity with the absorption spectrum of the Fe(III)/hydroxamate complex. The effects of the reagents concentrations were evaluated by a Box-Bhenken experimental design and the optimized condition was 0.20 mol L−1 hydroxylamine, 0.30 mol L−1 NaOH, and 5.0 mmol L−1 Fe2(SO4)3. A linear response range was achieved from 3.0 to 30.0% (v/v) of biodiesel, described by equation G = 59.4 + 1.72 C (r = 0.999). The coefficient of variation and the limit of detection (99.7% confidence level) were estimated at 0.9% (n = 10) and 1.0% (v/v) of biodiesel, respectively. The proposed procedure consumed only 10 µL of sample, 830 μg NH2OH.HCl, and 110 μg Fe(III) and generated ca. 1.0 mL of residue per determination. The results for determination of biodiesel in diesel blends agreed with those obtained by the official method EN14078 at the 95% confidence level. The proposed procedure also allows monitoring formation of fatty acid methyl esters during the transesterification reaction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Lepidopterans are recognized to be recalcitrant to gene silencing by RNAi. As such, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) delivery needs to be adjusted to assure its stability until it reaches the target gene transcript for silencing. Gene silencing by RNAi offers the potential to be used in the control of Tuta absoluta (Meyrick), one of the main insect pests of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) worldwide. Here, we tested the delivery of dsRNA expressed in Escherichia coli HT115(DE3) and supplied to larvae in an artificial diet by screening target genes for silencing. We tested six target genes: juvenile hormone inducible protein (JHP); juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase protein (JHEH); ecdysteroid 25-hydroxylase (PHM); chitin synthase A (CHI); carboxylesterase (COE); and arginine kinase (AK). RESULTS: Based on larval mortality, the duration of the larval stage in days, pupal weight, and the accumulation of the target gene transcript, we demonstrated the efficacy of bacterial dsRNA delivery for the functional effects on larval development. Providing dsRNA targeted to JHP, CHI, COE and AK by bacteria led to a significant decrease in transcript accumulation and an increase in larval mortality. CONCLUSION: Bacteria expressing dsRNA targeting essential T. absoluta genes supplied in artificial diet are efficient to screen RNAi target-genes. The oral delivery of dsRNA by bacteria is a novel potential alternative for the control of T. absoluta based on RNAi. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry	Article	Scopus

Under suitable experimental conditions, the emission intensity is directly proportional to the analyte amount in the ablated sample mass, which, in turn, is proportional to the number of laser pulses. Thus, two ablated mass functions are generated by plotting the analyte emission intensities as a function of the number of accumulated laser pulses in the test sample or in the calibration standard (either a CRM or a reference sample). The analytes mass fractions in the test samples are determined from the ratio of the corresponding slopes. The feasibility of this approach, named as slope ratio calibration (SRC-LIBS), was demonstrated by determinations of macro- (Ca, Mg, and P) and micronutrients (B, Mn, Cu, Fe, and Zn) in plant leaves in the form of pressed pellets. In order to minimize drawbacks related to analytes microheterogeneity, the pressed pellets were sampled at 30 different sites for each number of laser pulses. Calibrations performed within 5 and 30 laser pulses per site yielded linear correlation coefficients higher than 0.99 for all the analytes. The accuracy of the proposed calibration strategy was assessed from the analysis of five CRMs, as well as comparison with the results obtained for sugarcane leaves by ICP OES after microwave-assisted acid digestion, with agreement at the 95% confidence level. Results were more accurate than those determined by the single-point calibration strategy and by external calibration with a set of CRMs. The proposed approach is then a fast, simple, and practical calibration strategy, by requiring only a single standard for quantitative analysis by LIBS. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The aim was to verify the influence of a range of doses of gamma radiation (40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 Gy) on the fertility of females and to evaluate several quality control parameters, such as fly emergence, sex ratio, flight ability and survival under stress, as well as the characterization of the morphology (measurement of length and width) of the ovaries and testicles of A. obliqua. Pupae with 24 h before adult emergence were irradiated at CENA/Universidade de São Paulo. The radiosterilization test showed no difference between treatments for the parameters of fly emergence, sex ratio and survival under stress. The radiation at doses above 40 Gy resulted in ovarian atrophy in females and the absence of egg production. In males, the radiation also affected testicular development. Considering the quality parameters assessed, the sterilization results obtained agreed with previous data in the literature for other A. obliqua strains, and the dose of 60 Gy could be considered as the best compromise between insect quality and full sterility for the Brazilian strain of A. obliqua evaluated. © 2020, Scientia Agricola.

Among plant viruses, tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) had been described as the most troublesome to tomato crops. Recently, tomato mottle mosaic virus (ToMMV) has gained attention. ToMV and ToMMV are now considered as major threats to tomato. Therefore, the study of some aspects of these viral species would be an advance for the understanding of the disease in the field. In this context, our work aimed: i) to look for possible recombination events in the emergence of ToMMV, ii) to verify the involvement of Tm-22 in the resistance against ToMMV, and iii) to evaluate the behavior of ToMV and ToMMV in tomato cultivars and hybrid lines. Our results revealed no recombination events involving ToMMV. Also, our results suggested that Tm-22 confers resistance to ToMMV. Brazilian commercial cultivars and hybrid lines ‘Alambra’, ‘Débora Max’, ‘Santa Clara’, ‘Santa Cruz’, ‘Bubble Candy’, ‘Kada’ and ‘Salada’ were evaluated with ToMMV and ToMV. Only ‘Alambra’ showed partial resistance to ToMMV and ToMV and ‘Debora Max’ to ToMV. Finally, it should be noted that these commercial tomato cultivars and hybrids tested were more susceptible to the Brazilian ToMMV isolate when compared to ToMV since the symptoms were much more drastic. The results presented here have important implications for breeding virus-resistant tomatoes. © 2019, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.	Article	Scopus

Here we optimize the catalyst in terms of metal content and reduction temperature in relation to its catalytic activity. We find that the intrinsic activity is higher for the GaPd2/SiO2 catalyst with a metal loading of 13 wt.% compared to catalysts with 23 wt.% and 7 wt.%, indicating that there is an optimum particle size for the reaction of around 8 nm. The highest catalytic activity is measured on catalysts reduced at 550°C. To unravel the formation of the active phase, we studied calcined GaPd2/SiO2 catalysts with 23 wt.% and 13 wt.% using a combination of in situ techniques: X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption near edge fine structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). We find that the catalyst with higher metal content reduces to metallic Pd in a mixture of H2/Ar at room temperature, while the catalyst with lower metal content retains a mixture of PdO and Pd up to 140°C. Both catalysts form the GaPd2 phase above 300°C, albeit the fraction of crystalline intermediate Pd nanoparticles of the catalyst with higher metal loading reduces at higher temperature. In the final state, the catalyst with higher metal loading contains a fraction of unalloyed metallic Pd, while the catalyst with lower metal loading is phase pure. We discuss the alloying mechanism leading to the catalyst active phase formation selecting three temperatures: 25°C, 320°C and 550°C. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Cyanobacterial extracts exhibit toxicity towards other microorganisms and cancer cells and, therefore, represent a source of potentially novel natural products for drug discovery. We tested 62 cyanobacterial strains isolated from various Brazilian biomes for antileukemic and antimicrobial activities. Extracts from 39 strains induced selective apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cancer cell lines. Five of these extracts also exhibited antifungal and antibacterial activities. Chemical and dereplication analyses revealed the production of nine known natural products. Natural products possibly responsible for the observed bioactivities and five unknown, chemically related chlorinated compounds present only in Brazilian cyanobacteria were illustrated in a molecular network. Our results provide new information on the vast biosynthetic potential of cyanobacteria isolated from Brazilian environments. © 2019 by the authors.	Article	Scopus

Our conceptual tool is designed to support policy makers to manage five selected soil functions and demands: productivity, water availability, nutrients, carbon sequestration, biodiversity. We applied it to Amazon's Agricultural frontier - the Upper Xingu River Basin, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil – one of the most rapidly changing regions in the basin. In this study we implemented an interdisciplinary, GIS-based, multi-model approach to understand how land use change due to agricultural expansion and intensification is affecting soil functions at the Amazon's Arc of Deforestation. Encompassing two large Brazilian Biomes, the tropical rain forest and the Cerrado (Brazilian Savannas), the study area of ~170.000km2 has undergone extensive changes in land use and land cover since the late 1970s. In only 40 years, the basin has already lost 30% of its natural vegetation, which was replaced mainly by pastures for cattle ranching. Since the early 2000s, a new cycle has started and currently the Upper Xingu River Basin is undergoing an increased agriculture intensification process (e.g., double cropping) to produce corn and soy bean for the international market. According to stakeholders, the main limiting factor for agriculture is infrastructure and absence of government. The lack of support affects markets and international trading with high costs for stocking and distribution of soy bean products. As proxies for soil indicator for supply we used a 2015 land use map derived from remote sensing data. Demand was expressed as annual productivity (kg/ha/y) from census data spatialized by land use type. Evapotranspiration was used as the proxy for water availability and water yield for demands. For a biodiversity indicator we used Indigenous Land and Conservation Units as suppliers and Legal Reserve and Permanent Protection Areas as demand (legal instruments). Nutrient Cycling supply was mapped based on a base saturation of 0-30 cm of almost 400 soil profiles and demand was mapped using average fertilizer application (NPK) spatialized by land use. Carbon storage and sequestration were derived from field measurements spatialized by land use and demands were generated using field carbon sequestration measurements and policy (Zero illegal deforestation target). Our results show that this approach can be applied to a range of landscapes and is a useful tool for decision making and policy implementation and support. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Therefore, it is important to understand the behavior of hexazinone at a variety of soil depths. The objective of this research was to evaluate the sorption and desorption of hexazinone throughout the soil profile. The sorption and desorption processes of14C-hexazinone [triazine-6-14C] at three soil depths (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) were evaluated by the equilibrium batch method, and the radioactivity of the herbicide was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Five different concentrations of hexazinone (0.12, 0.19, 0.25, 0.31, and 0.38 μg mL-1) in a methanol solvent were used. The concentrations of the herbicide in equilibrium and sorbed in the soil were adjusted by using isotherms according to the Linear, Freundlich, and Langmuir models. Hexazinone sorption at soil depths of 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm showed decreasing Freundlich coefficients (Kf) with values of 0.18, 0.11, and 0.08 g(1-1/n) L1/n kg-1 (50.49, 47.58, and 46.37% sorbed), and in the desorption the Kf were 7.96, 7.93, and 9.82 g(1-1/n) L1/n kg-1 (26.17, 26.58, and 28.68% desorbed), respectively. The small difference in organic carbon content between soil depths was sufficient to affect hexazinone retention, interfering with the bioavailability of this product in the soil solution for weed control. © This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided that the original author and source are credited.

During biological wastewater treatment, organic matter is converted into a complex matrix containing a variety of soluble organic compounds. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the removal efficiency of the residual organic load in the final effluent from wastewater treatment plant with a conventional activated sludge process by different coagulants and parameters of coagulation-flocculation process, using dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, molecular weight (MW) size distribution by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), and zeta potential (ZP) analyses. The results showed a DOC removal efficiency up to 45% with iron chloride, and of 38% for aluminum sulfate and 31% for PAC coagulants. ZP was also measured during the procedures and authors conclude that the ZP also does not have a determining role in these removals. SEC and MS assessment was able to detect changes on secondary effluent molecular weight distribution profile after effluent coagulation-flocculation, this technique might be a promising tool to understand the composition of effluent organic matter and be helpful to estimate and optimize the performance of wastewater effluents treatment processes. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

They regulate diverse complex biological processes, including secondary xylem differentiation and wood formation. Recent genomic and transcriptomic studies of Tectona grandis L.f. (teak), one of the most valuable hardwood trees in the world, have allowed identification and analysis of developmental genes. In the present work, T. grandis NAC genes were identified and analyzed regarding to their evolution and expression profile during wood formation. We analyzed the recently published T. grandis genome, and identified 130 NAC proteins that are coded by 107 gene loci. These proteins were classified into 23 clades of the NAC family, together with Populus, Eucalyptus, and Arabidopsis. Data on transcript expression revealed specific temporal and spatial expression patterns for the majority of teak NAC genes. RT-PCR indicated expression of VND genes (Tg11g04450-VND2 and Tg15g08390-VND4) related to secondary cell wall formation in xylem vessels of 16-year-old juvenile trees. Our findings open a way to further understanding of NAC transcription factor genes in T. grandis wood biosynthesis, while they are potentially useful for future studies aiming to improve biomass and wood quality using biotechnological approaches. © 2019 by the authors.

Sugarcane is one crop with a large P footprint because production is centered on P-fixing soils with low P availability (Roy et al., Nature Plants, 2016, 2, 16043; Withers et al., Scientific Reports, 2018, 8, 2537). As global demand for processed sugar and bioethanol continues to increase, we advocate that improving P efficiency could become a key sustainability goal for the sugarcane industry. Here, we applied the 5R global P stewardship framework (Withers et al., Ambio, 2015, 44, 193) to identify more sustainable options to manage P in Brazilian sugarcane production. We show that current inputs of P fertilizer to the current crop area could be reduced by over 305 Gg, or 63%, over the next three decades by reducing unnecessary P fertilizer use, better utilization of recyclable bioresources and redesigning recommendation systems. Adoption of these 5R options would save the sugarcane industry in Brazil 528 US$ million and help safeguard global food and energy security. © 2019 The Authors.

The species is similar to H. stellata, presenting a pinkish inflorescence, congested and non-divided branches, pinkish and large floral bracts hiding the sepals, spatulate petals with a slightly reflexed apex. However, it differs by the white petals, as a diagnostic characteristic. The type specimen was collected in a small forest fragment and here this species is categorized as Vulnerable. Additionally, we compared this new species to Hohenbergia belemii and H. capitata, which are also similar to H. stellata, due to the red/pinkish characteristics of the branches, with large flowers and well-developed floral bracts.

The basal substrate was incubated without additives (control, CTL) and with monensin (MON, 6 μM/g DM) or patchouli essential oil (PEO, 90 μg/g DM) for 24 h. In three different runs, the gas production (GP) was recorded at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h of incubation using a semi-automatic system. The results revealed that MON had decreased (P < 0.05) the net GP and CH4 production and digestible and metabolizable energy relative to PEO supplementation. The in vitro truly degraded organic matter was not influenced by PEO application, while was reduced (P = 0.027) with MON. Both PEO and MON had similar reducing effect on the activity of carboxymethylcellulase (P = 0.030), in vitro truly degraded neutral detergent fiber (P = 0.010), NH3-N concentrations (P = 0.012), acetate proportion (C2, P = 0.046), C2 to C3 ratio (P = 0.023), and total protozoal count (P = 0.017). Both additives recorded similar elevating potential on the α-amylase activity (P = 0.012), propionate (C3) proportion (P = 0.011), and microbial protein (P = 0.034) compared with CTL. Effects of MON and PEO on ruminal feed degradability, microbial enzyme activities, and total protozoa counts may be responsible for modifying rumen fermentation ecology. Addition of PEO may act as a desirable alternative rumen modifier for MON in ruminant diets. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	Article	Scopus

It is known to be hazardous for animals' health, mobile in the soil, and its analysis is considered expensive and onerous. Solute movement studies are essential to provide information about dangerous molecules movement, which can avoid contamination. While field investigations demand time and financial resources, numerical models are an alternative to describe water and solute distribution in the soil profile. Thus, the objective of this work was to use HYDRUS 2-D model for simulations of atrazine movement in containers packed with tropical soil cultivated with corn and to compare simulated and observed data through statistical parameters. The research was carried out in a greenhouse during 116 days after planting. Atrazine was analyzed in the soil solution at three different depths to validate HYDRUS-2D. Simulations were carried out using hydraulic properties fitted directly to measured retention data and parameters for corn growing and atmospheric characteristics. The mixed procedure analysis indicated that there are differences in atrazine concentration among depths and along time. In general, atrazine concentration is higher at shallow depths and right after application. However, it is possible to find atrazine in deeper soil layers, which might be a concern regarding contamination. RMSE, Willmott and Pearson coefficients indicated a favorable capacity of the model to simulate atrazine concentration on corn cultivation. HYDRUS-2D is a reliable tool to obtain trends in atrazine movement under these experiment's conditions. The uptake parameters, the crop root growth and distribution parameters depend on further specific studies to better describe the relationship between the plant and atrazine and meteorological parameters need to be updated. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

However, changes in regional vegetation and ecosystems have not been part of this discussion, and other cave proxies such as speleothem δ13C values, a useful proxy for vegetation reconstruction, have been neglected due to interpretive complexities. Here we report δ13C values and 87Sr/86Sr ratios in stalagmites, together with XRF-derived elemental chemistry, δ13Corg values and carbon content from a sedimentary profile from the same cave where the stalagmites were collected. In combination with a previously published δ18O record, this enables us to clarify climate and environmental shifts that occurred between the Last Glacial Maximum and the Holocene in central South America. We show that vegetation was sparse during the last glacial period in spite of a previously inferred strong monsoon, and that changes in atmospheric pCO2 combined with local hydrological and temperature feedbacks may have determined vegetation development during this time. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluated forage production, chemical composition, in vitro total gas production and organic matter degradability of Brachiaria brizantha under contrasting CO2 atmospheric conditions in a free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) facility. The forage plants were sown in each of the 12 octagonal rings of the FACE facility: six under ambient atmospheric CO2 concentration of approximately 390 μmol/mol, hereafter referred to as control (CON) plots, and other six rings enriched with pure CO2 flux to achieve a target CO2 concentration of 550 μmol/mol, hereafter called elevated CO2 (eCO2) plots. Soil samples were collected to determine carbon and nitrogen concentrations. After seventy days of sowing, a standardization cutting was performed and then at regular intervals of 21 days the forage was harvested (ten harvest dates) and forwarded to laboratorial analyses. Forage above-ground biomass production (dry matter (DM): 6,143 vs. 6,554 kg/ha), as well as morphological characteristics (leaves: 71% vs. 68%; stem: 28% vs. 31%), chemical composition (crude protein: 162.9 vs. 161.8; neutral detergent fibre: 663.8 vs. 664.3; acid detergent fibre: 369.5 vs. 381; lignin: 60.1 vs. 64.1 g/kg DM; total C: 45.9 vs. 45.9; total N: 2.8 vs. 2.8; total S: 0.2% vs. 0.2%), organic matter in vitro degradability (573.5 vs. 585.3 g/kg), methane (5.7 vs. 4.3 ml/g DM) and total gas (128.3 vs. 94.5 ml/g DM) production did not differ significantly between CON and eCO2 treatments (p >.05). The results indicated that at least under short-term enrichment, B. brizantha was not affected by eCO2. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	Article	Scopus

In this study, the diagnosis and recommendation integrated system (DRIS) and nutritional balance index (NBI) were evaluated as auxiliary tools for diagnosing nutritional disorders in two Panicum maximum genotypes (Tanzania and Massai) which have contrasting behaviors for Cd translocation from roots to shoot. The correlation between nutritional disorders and Cd translocation in these plants was also checked. N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn concentrations in shoots of both grasses were extracted from studies previously published to form the database and develop DRIS, in which P. maximum cv. Tanzania was exposed to 0, 1, and 2 mmol L−1 of Cd, for eleven days, while P. maximum cv. Massai was exposed to 0, 0.1 and 0.5 mmol L−1 of Cd, for nine days. DRIS and NBI were obtained by calculations from nutrient concentrations in the shoot. Only P, S, and Zn concentrations in the shoot of P. maximum cv. Tanzania and P, K, S, Cu, and Fe in the shoot of P. maximum cv. Massai were Cd-disturbed from the point of view of nutrient concentration. However, DRIS revealed that the concentrations of Fe and Mn in the shoot of P. maximum cv. Tanzania exposed to Cd were considerably higher compared to other nutrients, enabling us to better understand certain biochemical and physiological Cd-induced events which occurred. Moreover, DRIS revealed that the Cd-induced nutritional disorders in the shoot of P. maximum cv. Massai were Cd-level dependent, and NBI confirmed that nutritional Cd-induced disorders in P. maximum increased when Cd translocation from roots to shoot was higher. In conclusion, DRIS and NBI revealed Cd-induced nutritional disorders that had previously been obscure. Therefore, their use as auxiliary tools for diagnosing Cd-induced nutritional disorders is recommended. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	Article	Scopus

In the present study, we estimated the contribution of POC delivered to a first-order stream from upslope sugarcane fields and a riparian forest in southeast Brazil. The results show that the amount of surface runoff and soil erosion generated in the riparian forest is significantly lower than in the upslope sugarcane field. However, the contribution of the forest to the total stream bed POC was above 70%, even though most sediments delivered to the stream originated from the upland sugarcane fields. The discrepancy between sediment and POC delivery from both land uses is a consequence of the presence of preferential runoff pathways from the agricultural fields, through the buffer strips, to the stream. This disconnection between the main sources of sediment and POC to the first-order stream is a potentially important mechanism influencing the transfer of POC from upslope areas to waterways. This mechanism should be considered in order to more reliably assess fluxes of OC from upslope areas to first-order streams in landscapes where arable land is separated from streams by a semi-natural buffer zone with permanent vegetation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, residual methanol in crude glycerol can be harmful to animal health. Several methods exist for quantifying methanol residues in biodiesel, yet few have been described that identify the methanol level in crude glycerol. We propose a method for determining the methanol level in crude glycerol destined for animal feed. Crude glycerol was extracted from the headspace and quantified by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The method was linear up to 0.5% of methanol. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 0.015 and 0.031%, respectively. No significant matrix effects were observed. Precision was 2% at the 0.05 and 0.5% levels. The average percentage of recovery was 90%. Three analyzed samples of crude glycerol had methanol residues of 0.027-7.802%. Furthermore, this methanol quantification method may be externally or internally calibrated using a GC manual injector. A reduction of at least 20% in running time was obtained with good resolution between the peaks. Thus, this method can be applied to determine the methanol level in crude glycerol according to the upper limits for animal feed (5,000 ppm) and for human consumption (150 ppm). Finally, this method is useful for the quality control of crude glycerol intended for use in animal feed, enabling the alternative use of this by-product to add value to the biodiesel production chain. © 2019, Scientia Agricola.

We conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) using additive and heterozygous (dis)advantage models to find candidate genes for root and shoot traits under nitrogen (N) stress and N stress plus A. brasilense. A total of 52,215 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers were used for GWAS analyses. For the six root traits with significant inoculation effect, the GWAS analyses revealed 25 significant SNPs for the N stress plus A. brasilense treatment, in which only two were overlapped with the 22 found for N stress only. Most were found by the heterozygous (dis)advantage model and were more related to exclusive gene ontology terms. Interestingly, the candidate genes around the significant SNPs found for the maize–A. brasilense association were involved in different functions previously described for PGPB in plants (e.g. signaling pathways of the plant’s defense system and phytohormone biosynthesis). Our findings are a benchmark in the understanding of the genetic variation among maize hybrids for the association with A. brasilense and reveal the potential for further enhancement of maize through this association. © 2019 Vidotti et al.

In a companion paper (Longo et al., 2019a), we described how the model solves the energy, water, and carbon cycles, and verified the high degree of conservation of these properties in long-term simulations that include long-term (multi-decadal) vegetation dynamics. Here, we present a detailed assessment of the model's ability to represent multiple processes associated with the biophysical and biogeochemical cycles in Amazon forests. We use multiple measurements from eddy covariance towers, forest inventory plots, and regional remote-sensing products to assess the model's ability to represent biophysical, physiological, and ecological processes at multiple timescales, ranging from subdaily to century long. The ED-2.2 model accurately describes the vertical distribution of light, water fluxes, and the storage of water, energy, and carbon in the canopy air space, the regional distribution of biomass in tropical South America, and the variability of biomass as a function of environmental drivers. In addition, ED-2.2 qualitatively captures several emergent properties of the ecosystem found in observations, specifically observed relationships between aboveground biomass, mortality rates, and wood density; however, the slopes of these relationships were not accurately captured. We also identified several limitations, including the model's tendency to overestimate the magnitude and seasonality of heterotrophic respiration and to overestimate growth rates in a nutrient-poor tropical site. The evaluation presented here highlights the potential of incorporating structural and functional heterogeneity within biomes in Earth system models (ESMs) and to realistically represent their impacts on energy, water, and carbon cycles. We also identify several priorities for further model development. © 2019 Author(s).	Article	Scopus

Measured information about root density can be summarized in adjustable equations applied in hydrological models. We present such descriptive functions used to model root density distribution over depth and evaluate their quality of fit to measured crop root density profiles retrieved from the literature. An equation is presented to calculate the mean root half-distance as a function of depth from root length density profiles as used in single root models for water uptake. To assess the importance of the shape of the root length density profile in hydrological modeling, the sensitivity of actual transpiration predictions of a hydrological model to the shape of root length density profiles is analyzed using 38 years of meteorological data from Southeast Brazil. The cumulative root density distributions covering the most important agricultural crops (in terms of area) were found to be well described by the logistic function or the Gompertz function. Root length density distribution has a consistent effect on relative transpiration, hence on relative yield, but the common approach to predict transpiration reduction and irrigation requirement from soil water storage or average water content is shown to be only partially supported by simulation results. © 2019 by the authors.

Brasilonema is a cyanobacterial genus found on the surface of mineral substrates and plants such as bromeliads, orchids and eucalyptus. B. octagenarum stands out among cyanobacteria due to causing damage to the leaves of its host in an interaction not yet observed in other cyanobacteria. Previous studies revealed that B. octagenaum UFV-E1 is capable of leading eucalyptus leaves to suffer internal tissue damage and necrosis by unknown mechanisms. This work aimed to investigate the effects of B. octagenarum UFV-E1 inoculation on Eucalyptus urograndis and to uncover molecular mechanisms potentially involved in leaf damage by these cyanobacteria using a comparative genomics approach. Results. Leaves from E. urograndis saplings were exposed for 30 days to B. octagenarum UFV-E1, which was followed by the characterization of its genome and its comparison with the genomes of four other Brasilonema strains isolated from phyllosphere and the surface of mineral substrates. While UFV-E1 inoculation caused an increase in root and stem dry mass of the host plants, the sites colonized by cyanobacteria on leaves presented a significant decrease in pigmentation, showing that the cyanobacterial mats have an effect on leaf cell structure. Genomic analyses revealed that all evaluated Brasilonema genomes harbored genes encoding molecules possibly involved in plant-pathogen interactions, such as hydrolases targeting plant cell walls and proteins similar to known virulence factors from plant pathogens. However, sequences related to the type III secretory system and effectors were not detected, suggesting that, even if any virulence factors could be expressed in contact with their hosts, they would not have the structural means to actively reach plant cytoplasm. Conclusions. Leaf damage by this species is likely related to the blockage of access to sunlight by the efficient growth of cyanobacterial mats on the phyllosphere, which may hinder the photosynthetic machinery and prevent access to some essential molecules. These results reveal that the presence of cyanobacteria on leaf surfaces is not as universally beneficial as previously thought, since they may not merely provide the products of nitrogen fixation to their hosts in exchange for physical support, but in some cases also hinder regular leaf physiology leading to tissue damage.

However, an extract must be produced for its application, which is difficult considering the rigid characteristics of raw propolis. Superfine grinding, a process capable of reducing particle size, enables the extraction of most bioactive compounds in propolis. This study evaluated the influence of grinding on size characteristics, antioxidant and antifungal properties of Brazilian green propolis for food preservation. The propolis powder was produced through six different types of grinding (different sieves and rpm), and its quality was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. After grinding, extracts and bioactive assays were produced and the total phenolic content, antioxidant and antifungal capacity were determined. The data showed that the grinding process affected all the results of bioactive assays used. Treatment B (sieve 0.08 mm, 12,000 rpm) presented statistically significant values for the bioactivity assays and thus antifungal activity against Rhizopus stolonifer (doses 0-5 %) was tested only for the control (standardized size without superfine grinding) and treatment B. Both treatments showed antifungal activity, but the control provided more effective mycelial growth inhibition (lower dose 1 %). Superfine grinding increased the antioxidant activity, although this behavior was not observed in the antifungal assay. Despite these results, green propolis extracts present important biological effects that indicate their use as food preservatives to extend shelf life of food products. © 2019, Scientia Agricola.

This study aimed to characterize the CSs available on the Brazilian market to support their potential use as foliar fertilizers. We selected five CSs containing Mn, five CSs containing Zn and three CSs containing Cu from five different companies. In each product, the mean particle size was evaluated by dynamic light scattering (DLS), the particle shape and size were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the aggregation degree was determined by the zeta potential and the heavy metal contents were determined by acid digestion followed by reading on ICP-OES. The mean hydrodynamic diameter of fertilizers containing Cu, Mn and Zn was 315 ± 55, 378 ± 184 and 435 ± 107 nm, respectively. The zeta potential varied from –20 to –30 mV, indicating potential particle aggregation and formation of higher structures. SEM images indicated great variation in the size and shape of the particles in each product. All products exhibited concentrations of toxic elements within the legislation thresholds. The average particle size of CSs currently marketable in Brazil does not allow their classification as nanomaterials (< 100 nm). Therefore, their foliar absorption is unlikely, once the particle size is higher than the exclusion limit observed for stomata and cuticle pathways, as well as the nutrient content as ions is low according to the solubility constant. © 2020, Scientia Agricola.

However, indiscriminate straw removal may deplete soil quality, particularly induced by its negative effects on soil microbial communities. A 2-year field study was conducted in soils classified as Oxisol (site 1) and Ultisol (site 2) in southeastern Brazil. The experiment started after plant cane cycle, establishing three straw removal rates (treatments), as follows: total removal, moderated removal, and no removal of sugarcane straw from the field. The amount of straw left on the soil surface and removed in the treatments varied according to the straw yield of each year and location. Soil samples were collected at 0–5- and 5–10-cm layers. The total abundance of bacteria, archaea, and fungi were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Bulk density, pH, base saturation, cation exchange capacity, phosphorus (P), and total organic C and soil microbial biomass C (MBC) were also measured. The soil chemical results indicate that the Oxisol presents higher inherent soil fertility compared with the Ultisol. In the first year, the straw had a different significant effect for bacterial and archaeal abundance in both soils and for fungi in the Oxisol site. In the second year, the numbers of gene copies of bacteria, archaea, and fungi in the 0–5-cm layer were higher under moderated and no removal when compared with those under total removal, regardless of site. The MBC decreased significantly under total removal of straw at the Ultisol site. Moderate straw removal has no significant effect on the abundance of soil microbes, but total straw removal may induce sharp reductions (from 23 to 54%) on microbial abundance. Soil microbes are a sensitive indicator to assess soil changes induced by crop residue management and should be taken into account for defining sugarcane straw management towards a sustainable bioenergy production. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

This study employed X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) to trace the in vivo absorption and transport of ZnO and ZnSO4(aq) to soybean leaves (Glycine max). XRF maps monitored over 48 h showed a shape change of the dried ZnSO4(aq) droplet, indicating Zn2+ absorption. Conversely, these maps did not show short movement of Zn from ZnO. XRF measurements on petioles of leaves that received Zn2+ treatments clarified that the Zn absorption and transport in the form of ZnSO4(aq) was faster that of ZnO. Solubility was the major factor driving ZnSO4(aq) absorption. XANES speciation showed that in planta Zn is transported coordinated with organic acids. Because plants demand Zn during their entire lifecycle, the utilization of sources with different solubilities can increase Zn use efficiency. © 2019 American Chemical Society.	Article	Scopus

Fertiactyl® foliar fertilizer reduces injuries when mixed with glyphosate; however, it is important to establish which mechanisms are responsible for this protective action. This study aimed to evaluate the absorption and translocation of glyphosate applied separately and in mixture with Fertiactyl® in coffee seedlings. Absorption and translocation were performed with 14C-glyphosate applied separately and in mixture with Fertiactyl® at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 144 hours after application (HAA). Most of the 14C-glyphosate applied to coffee seedlings was not absorbed. The 14C-glyphosate applied separately had a higher absorption by coffee seedlings (6.5%) than in a mixture with Fertiactyl® (2.7%) at 144 HAA. The maximum translocation of the 14C-glyphosate applied separately was 0.69% at 81.2 HAA and in mixture with Fertiactyl® was 0.41% at 41.2 HAA. The treated leaves retained a higher percentage of 14C-glyphosate when applied separately (5.6% at 144 HAA) than in a mixture with Fertiactyl® (2.2% at 144 HAA). Low translocation (<1%) for the rest of the plant shoots was observed both for the 14C-glyphosate applied separately and in combination with Fertiactyl®. Therefore, Fertiactyl® decreased the absorption and translocation of 14C-glyphosate in coffee seedlings. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	Article	Scopus

Low cost alternatives should be investigated for the substitution of this type of material in the removal of herbicides from water. In this context, the aim of this research was to evaluate four agro-industrial residues (white grape bagasse, corn straw, peanut shell and soybean hull) as adsorbents of diuron and hexazinone in drinking water. Samples of drinking water were collected from sources used for human consumption. Five concentrations (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mg mL-1) of each herbicide were added to the potable water samples. Each experimental unit consisted of 10 mL of a solution of water and herbicide with 0.1 g of each agro-industrial residue. Sorption was evaluated using the batch equilibrium method. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the amount of herbicide present in the aqueous solution. The Kf (Freundlich coefficient) of diuron was higher (2.99-11.93 mmol(1-1/n) L1/n kg-1) than hexazinone (2.31-4.61 mmol(1-1/n) L1/n kg-1) for all adsorbents used. Diuron percentage sorption was higher with white grape bagasse (51.15%) and peanut husk (52.44%), and hexazinone with corn straw (22.77%) and white grape marc (21.48%), than other agro-industrial waste for both herbicides. Even though the sorption of diuron was more pronounced than that of hexazinone, the sorption values obtained in this study were less than 52.44% and considered unsatisfactory in terms of effective removal from contaminated water. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira da Ciencia das Plantas Daninha.

We investigated different P fractions and their transformations in different land uses (primary forest and pasture) and soil textures (clayey and sandy) in Amazonian Oxisols using path analysis. Besides P fractionation, phosphatase activity and its correlation with soil carbon (C):organic P (Po) ratio was evaluated to correlate it with soil P nutritional status. After 15 years from forest slashing and burning, total P in pasture reaches to the forest levels in Amazonian soils, regardless of soil texture. Path analysis showed that land use conversion from forest to pasture decreased the diversity of the contribution of P pools to buffer P extracted by anion exchange resin. However, Po accounted for one-fourth of total P in our sites, it plays an important role as source of plant available P and contributed more in pasture compared to forest. Our results from P fractionation and C:Po ratio revealed that Amazonian pastures and forests are not P deficient. We also showed that with increasing C:Po ratio, plant-available P content became more dependent on P mineralization. Soil acid phosphatase activity can be used as an indicator for evaluating soil P nutritional status; however, its range changes according to the land use. © 2019	Article	Scopus

However, some NPs have toxicological properties, making these materials potential emerging pollutants. Therefore, it is important to investigate the uptake, transformation, translocation, and deposition of NPs in plants. In this work, laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and micro X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) were used to investigate the uptake and translocation of La2O3 NPs to stem and leaves of Pfaffia glomerata (Spreng.) Pedersen after in vitro cultivation of plants in the presence of 400 mg L-1 of La2O3 NPs. By using LA-ICP-MS and μ-XRF, image of the spatial distribution of La in the leaves was obtained, where higher concentration of La was observed in the main veins. Differences in the signal profile of La in leaves of plants cultivated in the presence of bulk La2O3 (b-La2O3) and La2O3 NPs were observed. Sharp peaks of La indicated that NPs were transported to the stems and leaves of plants treated with La2O3 NPs. Both LA-ICP-MS and μ-XRF techniques have shown to be useful for detecting NPs in plants, but LA-ICP-MS is more sensitive than μ-XRF and allowed better detection and visualization of La distribution in the whole leaf.

Two experiments were carried out; I—Evaluation of uptake and translocation of 14C-diclosulam (35 g a.i. ha−1) in C. juncea, at seven and 14 days after emergence. II—Evaluation of chlorophyll a transient fluorescence of dark-adapted C. juncea leaves when applied diclosulam in pre-emergence. Plants of C. juncea presented an anatomical/metabolic barrier to diclosulam translocation in the stem, which may confer tolerance to this herbicidal, besides reduced translocation due to low accumulation in the cotyledons. In addition, plants can maintain photosynthetic metabolism active when growing in soil with diclosulam by not changing the dynamics of energy dissipation. Thus, when cultivated in soil with residual of diclosulam, C. juncea can tolerate the herbicide to maintain plant growth. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

While glyphosate contributes to controlling weeds, it can interfere with spray mixture stability and, supposedly, complex with micronutrients within the plant tissue. This study investigated the effects of glyphosate on soybean foliar uptake and transport of Mn supplied as MnSO4, MnHPO3, Mn-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), and MnCO3. These fertilizers induced ultrastructural changes in the leaf cuticle, regardless of the glyphosate mixture. Except for MnCO3, all tested sources increased the Mn content in the petiole. The mixture of glyphosate impaired Mn transport from MnSO4 and MnHPO3, but no evidence of Mn-glyphosate complexation within the plant was found. Manganese is rather transported in a similar chemical environment regardless of the source, except for Mn-EDTA, which was absorbed and transported in its pristine form.

Proper placement of PSCU + U (0.15 m below and 0.1 m to the side of seed row) in band application at sowing is necessary to reduce salt stress that can decrease dry weight (DU) and N uptake (NU) of maize plant compromising maize yield. It is not clear the proper N rate in the proper placement for band application of PSCU + U at maize sowing to avoid salt stress. In the current literature, reduction of N rates are being recommended using PSCU + U without consider the probably salt stress provided by high rates of PSCU + U. DW and NU in maize plant as well as soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were evaluated in a greenhouse pot trial. N treatments were equivalent to 0, 90, 180, 360 and 540 kg N ha−1 applied incorporated in band in two contrasting soils (Rhodic Eutrustox and Typic Haplustox) using 70%PSCU + 30%U. At V10 (vegetative leaf stage 10), DW and NU of maize aerial part had quadratic behavior in response to increase N rates in the Typic Haplustox soil. In the Rhodic Eutrustox was not observed known behavior for DW and NU in response to increase N rates. Soil pH and EC was higher in the fertilizer row than sowing row. A N rate above of 180 kg N ha−1 using 70%PSCU + 30%U incorporated in bands can reduce DW and NU in early maize plant growth associated with salt concentration of N fertilizer in a Typic Haplustox soil, which could compromise maize yield. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This study aimed to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of the formation of Histosols in a mountain environment in the State of Espírito Santo, southeastern region of Brazil. This information was used in a multiproxy approach to palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Our analysis of the profile indicated that the Histosol initially formed in a peatland. Multiproxy records indicate significant environmental changes in the formation of the peatland, which constituted the Histosol parent material. Slope position contributed to the formation of a hydromorphic environment, with low oxygen availability that prevent organic matter degradation. Organic deposits was initially caused by the process of terrestrialization at the beginning of the Late Holocene (~2.814 ± 28 cal BP) in a lacustrine environment, rich in Pediastrum and Botryoccocus colonies. This lacustrine environment would have formed when the climate was colder and humid, which favored the establishment of forested vegetation. The paludization process occurred after the lake filled (~771 ± 24 cal BP), with a transition to warmer weather and more open vegetation, similar to that of today. Applying palaeoenvironmental reconstruction techniques with multiple proxies facilitates the investigation of Histosol genesis. This approach allows results to be obtained beyond those classically used in pedology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

DW and NU in maize plant as well as soil pH and electrical conductive (EC) were evaluated in a greenhouse pot trial. Treatments consisted of different placements (0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 m below and 0, 0.05 and 0.1 m to the side of seed row) of fertilizers (70%PSCU + 30%U, and 100%U) applied at maize sowing in band at a rate equivalent to 180 kg N ha−1 in a Rhodic Eutrustox soil. Control treatment (without N) was also included. At V7 (vegetative leaf stage 7), N fertilizers placed 0.15 m below of seed row provided higher total DW, total NU, EC and pH (in fertilizer row) than 0.05 m and 0.1 m. 70%PSCU + 30%U provided higher total DW and total NU than 100%U in placement 0 m. In addition, 70%PSCU + 30%U placed 0.1 m to the side of seed row provided lower total NU and EC (in fertilizer row) than 0 m. 70%PSCU + 30%U and 100%U placement can negatively interfere maize in vegetative stage when applied incorporated in band at sowing. The proper placement for this condition was 0.15 m below and 0.1 m to the side of seed row. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	Article	Scopus

Here, metagenomics and network inference show that fungal infection of plant roots enriched for Chitinophagaceae and Flavobacteriaceae in the root endosphere and for chitinase genes and various unknown biosynthetic gene clusters encoding the production of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs). After strain-level genome reconstruction, a consortium of Chitinophaga and Flavobacterium was designed that consistently suppressed fungal root disease. Site-directed mutagenesis then revealed that a previously unidentified NRPS-PKS gene cluster from Flavobacterium was essential for disease suppression by the endophytic consortium. Our results highlight that endophytic root microbiomes harbor a wealth of as yet unknown functional traits that, in concert, can protect the plant inside out. © 2019 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Although the effect of CTS on bacterial community has been studied, it is unclear how the composition and diversity of archaeal community respond to CTS amendment and which environmental factors drive the community over time. Here, we hypothesize that the Archaea structure and composition respond to CTS amendment over the time. CTS had been previously applied annually along 6 years and this assessment occurred for 180 days following the application in the 7                             th                              year by using different rates (0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 ton ha                             −1                             ). We used amplicon 16S rRNA sequencing to assess the changes in the structure of the archaeal community. Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were the most abundant phyla found in soils with application of CTS, with Thaumarchaeota dominating the sequences in all samples with relative abundances of >98%. We observed a decreasing trend on the archaeal diversity over the time with increasing CTS application rate, together with an increase in the community similarity. The redundancy analyses (RDA) explained 43% of the total variation in operational taxonomic units and identified Na, pH, Cr and P as the main drivers of the archaeal community over time after application of highest CTS rates. CTS application changes the structure of Archaea community, with significant increase of Thaumarchaeota and Aenigmarchaeota groups, which can be further explored for its biotechnological use in contaminated soils.                          © 2019, The Author(s).

Yet, there is a poor discussion on the number of samples necessary to represent such variables that usually vary orders of magnitude in space. In the present paper, we examine the adequate number of samples for two soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) data sets: (1) normal distribution (a 40 year-old pasture) and (2) non-normal distribution (primary forest). To assess the adequate number of samples in each case, we used for normal distribution, an statistical criterion of standard deviation lower than 5% compared to a high sampling effort (n = 25) as an indicative of a proper representation of Ksat variability. In the case of non-normal distribution, we used the same criterion but using median absolute deviation (a non-parametric statistics). Both data sets were available in Salemi et al. (2013) and were Ksat measured at 0.15 m soil depth for medium-textured inceptisols in São Paulo State, Brazil. For each data set, we simulated 10 ‘new’ samplings in which we calculated mean and standard deviation from sample 1 to 25 (for normal data) and median and median absolute deviation (for non-normal data). We found that, on average, at least 17 to 22 samples had to be collected to meet the adopted criterion for normal data whereas 20 to 25 had to be collected for non-normal data. Such numbers of samples exceed those used in a number of papers. Additional examples of this method with a light modification are given to establish number of samples in new study areas as well as to estimate number of samples when comparing two (or more) land-uses. Simple and practical procedures like those presented here could estimate the number of samples that adequately represents soil hydraulic properties variability. © 2020 Federation of Eurasian Soil Science Societies.

Herein, we reported production of the unusual MAA, mycosporine-glycine-alanine (MGA) in the cyanobacte-rium Sphaerospermopsis torques-reginae ITEP-024 using a newly developed UHPLC-DAD-MS/HRMS (ultra-high per-formance liquid chromatography–diode array detection–high resolution tandem mass spectrometry) method. MGA had previously been first identified in a red-algae, but S. torques-reginae strain ITEP-024 is the first cyanobacteria to be reported as an MGA producer. Herein, the chemical structure of MGA is fully elucidated from one-dimensional / two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and HRMS data analyses. MAAs are unusually produced constitutively in S. torques-reginae ITEP-024, and this production was further enhanced following UV-irradiance. It has been proposed that MAA biosynthesis proceeds in cyanobacteria from the pentose phosphate pathway intermediate sedoheptulose 7-phos-phate. Annotation of a gene cluster encoded in the genome sequence of S. torques-reginae ITEP-024 supports these gene products could catalyse the biosynthesis of MAAs. However, addition of glyphosate to cultures of S. torques-reginae ITEP-024 abolished constitutive and ultra-violet radiation induced production of MGA, shinorine and porphyra-334. This finding supports involvement of the shikimic acid pathway in the biosynthesis of MAAs by this species. © 2020 The Korean Society of Phycology.	Article	Scopus

We previously showed that breeding for Fusarium-resistance in common bean changed the rhizosphere microbiome composition and functioning. Here, we assessed the impact of Fusarium-resistance breeding in common bean on microbiome physiology. Combined with metatranscriptome data, community-level physiological profiling by Biolog EcoPlate analyses revealed that the rhizosphere microbiome of the Fusarium-resistant accession was distinctly different from that of the Fusarium-susceptible accession, with higher consumption of amino acids and amines, higher metabolism of xylanase and sialidase, and higher expression of genes associated with nitrogen, phosphorus and iron metabolism. The resistome analysis indicates higher expression of soxR, which is involved in protecting bacteria against oxidative stress induced by a pathogen invasion. These results further support our hypothesis that breeding for resistance has unintentionally shaped the assembly and activity of the rhizobacterial community toward a higher abundance of specific rhizosphere competent bacterial taxa that can provide complementary protection against fungal root infections. © Copyright © 2019 Mendes, de Chaves, Fonseca, Mendes, Raaijmakers and Tsai.

However, the direct method of determining H+ Al presents several problems, such as inaccuracy of titration and long time to perform the analysis. Our objective was to optimize the calcium (Ca) acetate method to make it faster, more accurate and capable of being applied on a large scale in routine analysis. The simplified method to obtain the value of H+ Al was based on reading the pH after extraction with Ca acetate, without the need for titration with sodium hydroxide. The contents of H+ Al were obtained in soil samples with varying contents of organic matter (OM) and H+ Al after extraction with either 0.5 mol L−1 Ca acetate or Shoemaker, McLean, and Pratt (SMP) buffer solution. The extraction of H+ Al was affected by the nature and concentration of the extraction solution, and OM contents in the soils.

Surface horizons and deep Bh of Amazonian podzols were sampled and kept under refrigeration to maintain moisture of sampling time. Incubations of aliquot of the same sample were initiated on the sampling day and 3, 6, 9 and 12 days after sampling. Other aliquots were conducted on a tension table to given water potential (60 cm H2O) prior to incubation. • Soil samples, whether disturbed or not, should not be dried but kept at sampling moisture in semi-open plastic bags under refrigeration at 4 °C, respiration monitoring must be conducted without prior water potential adjustment. • In such conditions,12 days between sampling and beginning of measurement did not affected respiration results. • The method used for agricultural soils gave different results and does not make sense for soils under perudic moisture regime. © 2020 The Authors	Article	Scopus

Fecundity, pollen dispersal and mating patterns of roadside Qualea grandiflora Mart. trees	2019	Conservation Genetics	20	6		1355	1367	12	10.1007/s10592-019-01217-w	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072054045&doi=10.1007%2fs10592-019-01217-w&partnerID=40&md5=2e0e91369346287b2f4b3c950d972375	Forest fragmentation may affect mating and pollen dispersal patterns through conversion of continuous forests into small, spatially isolated remnant patches and individual trees in an anthropogenic landscape. We investigated reproductive investment and success, pollen dispersal, mating system, and genetic diversity and spatial structure of Qualea grandiflora trees in two environmental contexts: a continuous natural Cerrado area and isolated individuals on roadsides. Roadside trees produced more flowers and more fruit than Cerrado trees. Pollen dispersal kernels were fat-tailed in both contexts, indicating long-distance dispersal, but in Cerrado the mean pollen dispersal distance (524.7 m) and the effective number of pollen donors per mother-tree (Nep = 12.7) were higher than for roadside trees (60.9 m, Nep = 4.6). The levels and structure of genetic diversity, outcrossing rates (tm > 0.98), and mating among relatives (tm- ts < 0.1) were similar in both environmental contexts. Allelic richness and number of private alleles were similar between the two environments. The fixation index was significantly lower in adults (minimum of 0.08) than in offspring (minimum of 0.23) in both contexts, suggesting selection against inbred individuals between offspring and adult stage. Our results indicate that the spatial isolation of roadside trees, by increasing the number of flowers produced, decreased pollinator movements, thereby reducing effective pollen flow and the number of pollen donors. All these results suggest that roadside trees can be used for harvesting seeds for recovery plans, and that these trees are a biological legacy, and reservoir of Q. grandiflora genetic diversity, from the original Cerrado forest. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

Tannin supplementation may lead to positive results regarding aspects such as parasitic infections and methane (CH4) emissions. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of the condensed tannins (CT) extract made of powdered Acacia mearnsii bark (PAB) on nutrition, parasitic status and CH4 emissions in sheep artificially infected with Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Haemonchus contortus. Twenty 10-month old Santa Inês lambs (24.7 ± 3.14 kg of initial body weight) were used in a 50-day trial. Animals were divided in four treatment groups according to parasitic infection and PAB supplementation: two control groups without infections, one without PAB (C-) (n = 4) and one with PAB (C+) (n = 4); two infected groups, one without PAB (I-) (n = 6) and another receiving PAB (I+) (n = 6). Initially, animals were kept in individual pens where they were fed ad libitum chopped tifton 85 hay (Cynodon spp.) and 210 g/animal/day of concentrate. On the first day of experiment, animals of I- and I+ groups were artificially infected with infective larvae (L3) of T. colubriformis and H. contortus. Lambs were weighed fortnightly to calculate average daily body weight gain (ADG). Blood and faeces samples were also collected in the same moment of weighing for the evaluation of blood parameters and faecal egg count (FEC) respectively. After 40 days of experiment, measurements of CH4 emissions in small chamber system started and following that, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) assay was carried out in metabolic cages. In the end of experimental period (50 days), lambs were slaughtered and samples of abomasum and small intestine content were collected for worm count, identification, and eggs/female count. No significant (p > 0.05) treatment effects were verified for ADG, ATTD and worm count. Blood parameters were affected in both infected groups (p < 0.05) from the 28th experimental day onwards, when these animals started to show reduced red blood cells, haemoglobin and packed cell volume when compared to C- and C+. Decreased FEC was verified in I+ when compared to I- and also, H. contortus eggs/female worm for I+ was lower than for I- (p < 0.05). Both infected groups showed higher CH4 emissions than the control groups (p < 0.05). Results highlighted the anthelmintic potential of PAB and indicated methanogenic effect of parasitic nematode infections. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.	Article	Scopus

A Plackett-Burman design followed by a complete second order design were used for the screening of most important factors and to maximize the polygalacturonase activity, respectively. Maximum polygalacturonase activity was 52.8 U mL-1 at 48 hours of bioproduction. The kinetic evaluation for substrate consumption showed that 42% total organic carbon, 52 nitrogen, 23 magnesium, and 60% potassium were consumed. The crude enzyme complex was used on commercial mango juice clarification, and, at a 0.5% concentration (v v-1) reduced viscosity by 10%, turbidity by 12% and clarification by 23%. Therefore, the results presented in this study could provide valuable and beneficial information for the food and enzyme industries (juice) as well as being a new landmark to microbiology by providing essential knowledge on P. brasilianum growing needs. © 2020, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

The dry beans were irradiated with different doses (1, 5 and 10 kGy) of γ-radiation using 60Co as source. The composition and nutritional properties (protein, fat, ash, tannin, phytic acid content and protein in vitro digestibility) of the cooked beans were analyzed, with and without previously soaking process. In addition, the technological properties (hydration index, cooking time and color) of the beans were also evaluated. The results showed that protein, fat, ash and tannin content, as well as color, were not affected by irradiation, while the phytic acid was significantly reduced by the irradiation. Further, hydration index was slightly reduced only by using 10 kGy suggesting probable structure changes. Irradiation reduced the cooking time of the beans, as higher irradiation doses were used, which was related with the reduction on the phytic acid content. Moreover, protein in vitro digestibility was enhanced by irradiation. In conclusion, irradiation up to 10 kGy can be safely used to improve the shelf life of common beans without degradation of nutritional components, reducing some antinutrients content, improving protein digestibility and reducing the cooking time. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Targeted metabolomics confirmed the production of these metabolic compounds, except for the alkaloid scytonemin. Genome mining of N. spumigena CENA596 and its three closely related Nodularia strains-two planktonic strains from the Baltic Sea and one benthic strain from Japanese marine sediment-revealed that the number of BGCs in planktonic strains was higher than in benthic one. Geosmin-a volatile compound with unpleasant taste and odor-was unique to the Brazilian strain CENA596. Automatic annotation of the genomes using subsystems technology revealed a related number of coding sequences and functional roles. Orthologs from the Nodularia genomes are involved in the primary and secondary metabolisms. Phylogenomic analysis of N. spumigena CENA596 based on 120 conserved protein sequences positioned this strain close to the Baltic Nodularia. Phylogeny of the 16S rRNA genes separated the Brazilian CENA596 strain from those of the Baltic Sea, despite their high sequence identities (99% identity, 100% coverage). The comparative analysis among planktic Nodularia strains showed that their genomes were considerably similar despite their geographically distant origin. © 2020 by the authors.	Article	Scopus

The setup was designed to implement a versatile solvent extraction and pre-concentration strategy by combining flow-batch and multicommuted flow analysis approaches. The photometric method was based on Hg(II) reaction with dithizone in a chloroform medium, which was also used as the extracting organic solvent. The flow analysis system was composed of a homemade syringe pump module, a set of solenoid valves, two Aquarius mini-pumps, and a flow-batch chamber. The homemade photometer was comprised of a light emitting diode (LED), photodiode, and homemade flow cell (50 mm length). The flow system and photometer were controlled using an Arduino Due board, running custom-written software. After optimizing the operational conditions, the effectiveness of the developed system was evaluated for the determination of the mercury concentration in drinking water. For accuracy assessment, samples were analyzed using a spiking methodology and an independent method, yielding a recovery ranging from 92% to 108%. Other important characteristics of the proposed method were found as follows: linear response range, 0.5–10.0 μg L−1 (r = 0.9984); limit of detection 0.38 μg L−1 Hg(II); consumption of dithizone and chloroform, 1.85 μg L−1 and 0.8 mL per analysis, respectively; coefficient of variation, 2% (n = 10); sampling throughput, 20 determinations per h. © 2019	Article	Scopus

Adjuvants may change herbicides dynamics in the environment and improve their efficiency for weed control. The objective of this work was to evaluate sorption and desorption of pendimethalin alone and in mixture with adjuvant in soil and sugarcane straw. Sorption experiments were performed using pendimethalin alone and in mixture with vegetable oil with herbicide solution concentrations ranging between 2.5 and 40 μg mL−1 for both conditions. Sorption distribution coefficient (Kd) for soil was 18.48 mL g−1 using pendimethalin alone. Kd value was not determined when pendimethalin was in mixture with adjuvant due to the complete retention of the herbicide in the soil regardless of the initial aqueous phase concentration. Sugarcane straw sorption experiment had Kd values corresponding to 355.52 and 27.24 mL g−1 for pendimethalin alone and in mixture with adjuvant, respectively, indicating the addition of vegetable oil may significantly decrease pendimethalin retention in the straw and could improve weed control. Besides all desorption coefficients were higher than the respective sorption coefficients, which means that the sorption process may be considered irreversible. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The research was carried out using soil samples from clonal plantations of eight-year-old rubber trees, located in the coastal plain (Tabuleiros Costeiros) of the state of Rio de Janeiro. The difference in the management of the rubber tree clone area promoted improvements in the soil quality, as it increased the carbon contents of the granulometric fractions, LFOM, and humic substances from the IAN 873 clone area. Both rubber tree areas evaluated presented higher mineral-associated organic carbon levels and humic substances than did the pasture area, reinforcing the reforestation potential of areas with degraded pastures through hevea culture. © 2020 Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ).

Understanding bacterial diversity and the relationships between bacteria and phytopathogens may be key to finding effective biocontrol agents. We evaluated the bacterial community associated with anthracnose symptomatic and asymptomatic leaves of guarana, a typical tropical crop. Bacterial communities were assessed through culture-independent techniques based on extensive 16S rRNA sequencing, and cultured bacterial strains were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of Colletotrichum sp. as well as for enzyme and siderophore production. The culture-independent method revealed that Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum, but many sequences were unclassified. The emergence of anthracnose disease did not significantly affect the bacterial community, but the abundance of the genera Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella were significantly higher in the symptomatic leaves. In vitro growth of Colletotrichum sp. was inhibited by 11.38% of the cultured bacterial strains, and bacteria with the highest inhibition rates were isolated from symptomatic leaves, while asymptomatic leaves hosted significantly more bacteria that produced amylase and polygalacturonase. The bacterial isolate Bacillus sp. EpD2-5 demonstrated the highest inhibition rate against Colletotrichum sp., whereas the isolates EpD2-12 and FD5-12 from the same genus also had high inhibition rates. These isolates were also able to produce several hydrolytic enzymes and siderophores, indicating that they may be good candidates for the biocontrol of anthracnose. Our work demonstrated the importance of using a polyphasic approach to study microbial communities from plant diseases, and future work should focus on elucidating the roles of culture-independent bacterial communities in guarana anthracnose disease. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Understanding the influence of anthropogenic activities on soil microbial communities would increase our ability to establish conservation strategies in the Amazon region, where deforestation has become a great concern. We hypothesized that forest-to-agriculture conversion in a short- and long-term is responsible for alterations in soil chemical properties, with consequences on the composition, diversity, and potential function of microbial communities. Here, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR to assess the bacterial and archaeal composition, diversity, abundance, and the potential functions related to the N-cycle in a natural forest and agricultural fields with 2-, 8-, and 20-years after conversion in the Amazon region. We observed that soil chemical properties were altered by the forest-to-agriculture conversion, which consequently affected the bacterial and archaeal communities. In general, Ca, Al, NH4 +, and N-total were significantly correlated to the overall microbial community structure. Forest-to-agriculture conversion also altered the microbial composition and potential functions related to the N-cycle, increasing the nitrification and denitrification processes in agricultural soils, while natural forest demonstrated to be a potential N2O sink. Together, our data demonstrated the impacts of forest-to-agriculture conversion in the Amazon region and add important information for future research that seeks the development of more sustainable agriculture. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

It is distinguished from A. nigropurpureus by the diameter of the tank, the morphology of the leaf, floral bracts, and sepals, by its sessile to nearly sessile flowers, its seed morphology, and by the presence of trichomes on both sides of the leaves. So far, the species is only known from Apuarema and Ibirapitanga municipalities. The type population was found in an unprotected area, fragmented by tracks and roads, where illegal logging takes place. Here we preliminarily assessed its conservation status as critically endangered. © Copyright 2019 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.	Article	Scopus

In this study, rice and soybean were cultivated under greenhouse conditions with the aim of evaluating Zn bioavailability and fractionation in a clayey-textured Typic Hapludox as a function of Zn rates (4 or 8 mg kg-1 Zn). The experiment was conducted until grain filling. Two soil subsamples (t1 and t2) that referred to the seeding and flowering stages, were collected and compared with two single extraction schemes, DTPA (ZnDTPAt1 and ZnDTPAt2) and Mehlich-1 (ZnMt1 and ZnMt2) for Zn available contents. Zn fractionation was carried out with t2 soil subsamples for the testing of the following fractions: Exchangeable Zn (ZnExc), Zn bound to carbonates (ZnCarb), Zn bound to organic matter (ZnOM), Zn bound to oxides (ZnOxi) and residual Zn (Znres). Zn applied to soil increased the Zn concentration in labile fractions in decreasing order as follows: ZnExc > ZnOM > ZnCarb. There was no difference between the lesser or unavailable fractions, ZnOxi and Znres, when there was no correlation between the rates either with total accumulated Zn in plants (Znatotal), or the contents extracted by DTPA or Mehlich-1. Total cumulative Zn content in rice and soybean affected by the ZnCl2 rates applied were positively correlated with Zn content extracted by both solutions. Both extractant solutions presented positive correlation between available contents of Zn with Zn bound to labile fractions. © 2020, Scientia Agricola. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

Tomato ripening is regulated by multiple transcription factors together with the plant hormone ethylene and their downstream effector genes. Transcription Factors APETALA2a (AP2a), NON-RIPENING (NOR) and FRUITFULL (FUL1/TDR4 and FUL2/MBP7) were reported as master regulators controlling tomato fruit ripening. Their proposed functions were derived from studies of the phenotype of spontaneous mutants or RNAi knock-down lines rather than, as it appears now, actual null mutants. To study TF function in tomato fruit ripening in more detail, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to knock out the encoding genes, and phenotypes of these mutants are reported for the first time. While the earlier ripening, orange-ripe phenotype of ap2a mutants was confirmed, the nor null mutant exhibited a much milder phenotype than the spontaneous nor mutant. Additional analyses revealed that the severe phenotype in the spontaneous mutant is caused by a dominant-negative allele. Our approach also provides new insight into the independent and overlapping functions of FUL1 and FUL2. Single and combined null alleles of FUL1 and FUL2 illustrate that these two genes have partially redundant functions in fruit ripening, but also unveil an additional role for FUL2 in early fruit development. © 2019, The Author(s).

We used 32P isotope dilution method to assess the P taken up by crops treated with PR. Two experiments, one with common bean and other with upland rice, were carried out, to evaluate the effect of S0 on the agronomic performance of two contrasting PR, applied in different methods. Gafsa (GPR) and Patos de Minas (PPR) were used as the high and low reactivity PR, respectively. The experiments were arranged in completely randomized design on factorial structure 2 × 2 × 2 + 2; which means 2 PR (GPR and PPR) versus 2 S0 condition (with or without-S0) versus 2 application methods (band and broadcast) plus 2 additional treatments (control and triple superphosphate). In band application the S0 increased the amount of P uptake by plants from fertilizer of GPR from 2.57 to 9.86 mg pot−1 for common bean and of 2.26 to 7.05 mg pot−1 to rice. Regardless the management adopted, less than 2% of P applied as PPR has been taken up by crops. The addition of S0 as a strategy to increase the agronomic performance of PR is PR characteristics dependent and fertilizers placement. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	Article	Scopus

Eight treatments were used in a randomized complete design with a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement: two diet (20C:80F and 80C:20F concentrate to forage ratio) and four levels of ENP addition (0%, 1.5%, 3.0%, and 4.5% of DM) replacing soybean meal. There was a diet × ENP interaction (p = 0.02) for methane production. According to ENP addition, diets with 80C:20F showed more intense reduction on methane production that 20C:80F. A negative linear effect was observed for propionate production with ENP addition in diet with 80C:20F and to the relative abundance of methanogens Archaea, in both diet. The replacement of soybean meal by ENP in levels up to 3% of DM inhibited methane production due to a reduction in the methanogens community without affecting the organic matter degradability. However, ENP at 4.5% of DM level affected fiber degradability, abundance of cellulolytic bacteria, and propionic acid production, indicating that this level of inclusion is not recommended for ruminant production. © 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science	Article	Scopus

According to recent phylogenetic studies, the most likely hypothesis to explain this migration is the sea-drift long-distance dispersal, but no research indicating the response of I. batatas seeds to seawater conditions have been performed so far. The aim of this study was to understand seawater resistance in I. batatas, an essential feature for the sea-drift natural dispersal hypothesis, thus shedding light on the historical biogeography of this species, which also has implications on human civilization history, as the archaeological presence of sweet potato in both continents has been used as an evidence of pre-Columbian contacts between ancient civilizations. The experiment consisted of submitting sweet potato seeds to seawater treatments and observing the respective germination rates after different periods of immersion. Subsequently, one-way ANOVAs were conducted to test for significant differences between groups. All seeds from the seawater immersion treatments germinated, which confirms that I. batatas seeds are resistant to seawater salinity for a period of 120 days. Our results support the sea-drift natural dispersal hypothesis, thus shedding light on part of the logical conditions for one of the major hypotheses on the historical biogeography of this species, which also plays an important role in the discussions related to prehistorical human mobility in Polynesian islands. © the authors, CC-BY 4.0 license	Article	Scopus

Synthesized Mg-Fe-NO3 LDH particles with Mg:Fe (2:1) were synthesized by coprecipitation and characterized by ICP-OES, XRD, FTIR and TGA analyses. Batch experiments with LDH particles containing 0.5, 0.1 or 0.01 M of KCl, K2SO4 or CaCl2 showed that 60 to 100% of intercalated nitrate is exchanged by anions within a few hours. Soil column studies with soils from temperate (Denmark) and tropical (Brazil) regions confirmed rapid release of nitrate from LDH. A reduction of 22% in nitrate leaching was the best result obtained for LDH applied to the Danish soils. The highest X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) intensities of Fe and Mg were recorded at the top 0.5 cm of tropical soil columns, showing the high retention of LDH residues at soil surface. Application of LDH to a soil profile with bulk density of 1300 kg m−3, 0.3 m rooting depth and a typical rate of field nitrogen application (120 kg ha−1) caused accumulation of 400 to 1050 kg Mg and 230 to 478 kg of Fe or Al depending on type of LDH. This high load of residual metals may restrain the use of the LDH as slow release nitrate source. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

In the agricultural field, these endophytes might be a strategy of biological control for phytopathogens. We aimed to isolate endophytic fungi from yellow passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) leaves, evaluating its biocontrol capacity by in vitro antagonism against phytopathogen Colletotrichum sp. CNPU378. We also carried out greenhouse experiments in bean seedlings. A high colonization frequency was obtained (89%), and the molecular identification based on DNA sequencing attested Colletotrichum as the most frequent genus and minor occurrence of Curvularia endophytes. The endophytes tested showed different types of competitive interactions in in vitro antagonism inhibition rate ranging from 28.8 to 48.8%. There were 10 promising antagonists tested for their antagonist activity of crude extracts of secondary metabolites, in which strain PE-36 (20.8%) stood out among the other strains evaluated. In the greenhouse assay, plants inoculated only with endophyte Colletotrichum sp. PE-36 was symptomless and suggest that the endophyte strengthened the growth promotion in common bean plants, especially in the root length and number of leaves when compared to control plants and other treatments. Despite many fungi of Colletotrichum genus being described as causative agents of anthracnose, in this study, the plant sampled was colonized predominantly by Colletotrichum endophytes living in asymptomatic relationship. By the way, we come across a Colletotrichum sp. endophyte able to antagonize a Colletotrichum sp. pathogen. © 2020, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa. All rights reserved.

This species of mosquito transmits arboviral infections, such as yellow fever, chikungunya, dengue, zika, and several encephalitides. The objective of this research was to provide a radiation dose inducing sterilization in adult male Ae. albopictus in the pupal stage. A cobalt-60 source of gamma radiation at a dose rate of 381 Gy/h was used. The pupae were irradiated with doses of 0 (control), 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 Gy. Each treatment had a total of five replications using 60 pupae. After irradiation, the different phases of Ae. albopictus development (egg, larva, pupa, and adult) in the F1 generation were observed daily. Parameters such as viability, fertility, longevity, and mortality were recorded. The results from these studies showed that a dose of 60 Gy was necessary to sterilize 100% of the male Ae. albopictus pupae. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	Article	Scopus

BFN can occur in sugarcane; however, its role in non-leguminous plants is controversial. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the nitrogen source contribution (using N isotope 15N technique) along a growing period in sugarcane plants under different management (diazotrophic bacteria inoculation and N fertigation rates). The natural abundance of nitrogen isotope (15N) abundance in + 1 leaves of fourth ratoon cultivar SP 80-3280 was used to indicate the comparative importance of N sources, including BFN for sugarcane nutrition. The treatments were irrigated with two levels of nitrogen fertilizer 50 and 100 kg ha−1 (urea source), including a control without fertilizer, with (I) and without (NI) inoculation of nitrogen-fixing bacterias. The bacteria cocktail used consisted of five strains: Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, Herbaspirillum seropedicae, H. rubrisubalbicans, Burkholderia tropica and Azospirillum amazonense. Although the nitrogen content in + 1 leaves, the above ground dry matter, cane yield and stalk sugar content expanded by increasing nitrogen fertilizer rates, no significant interactions between nitrogen-fixing bacteria inoculation and nitrogen fertilizer rates were observed. In the treatment without N fertilizer application, no differences in δ15N‰ (per thousand) values between sugarcane-inoculated and sugarcane-non-inoculated sugarcane leaves was found. The temporal variation of δ15N‰ in sugarcane + 1 leaves indicated that nitrogen content and δ15N‰ values decreased during the phenological development stages and that the main sources of nitrogen for sugarcane were from synthetic fertilizer and mineralization of nitrogen from soil organic matter. © 2018, Society for Sugar Research & Promotion.

To this end, the physiological, biochemical, anatomical, nutritional and molecular mechanisms associated to the plant tolerance against Cd toxicity were investigated in five tomato accessions with contrasting sensitivity to Cd exposure. Firstly, the data revealed that larger biomass loss was not always coupled to higher Cd concentration, indicating that other events, in addition to the internal Cd accumulation, impact tomato performance at early stages of Cd exposure. Secondly, the results indicated that the fine regulation of nutrient status, particularly magnesium (Mg), boron (B) and manganese (Mn), is associated to the mitigation of Cd toxicity. Magnesium status was coupled to the modulation of root development, resulting in changes in root hair formation and biomass allocation. Boron accumulation in leaves was linked to Cd toxicity, suggesting that tolerance mechanisms involved strategies to decrease or even avoid B excess in photosynthetic tissues. Disturbances in Mn status, i.e. Mn excess in leaves and Mn deficiency in roots, were also related to tomato sensitivity to Cd exposure. Thirdly, plant capacity to maintain leaf blade expansion is a relevant strategy for a better tomato development after short-term Cd exposure. Fourthly, tomato tolerance to Cd-induced stress does not depend on CAT activity enhancements in such conditions. In conclusion, tomato ability to quickly manage its nutritional status is necessary for alleviation of the Cd effects at early stages of exposure to this metal. The better understanding about tolerance mechanisms and mode of action of Cd toxicity in plants can help in the establishment of strategies to mitigate its impacts on crops. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

However, transcriptional regulation, although playing a central role in the decision-making process of cellular systems, is still poorly understood. In this study, we linked expression data with mathematical models to infer gene regulatory networks (GRN). We present a simple yet effective method to estimate transcription factors' GRNs from transcriptional data. Method: We defined interactions between pairs of genes (edges in the GRN) as the partial mutual information between these genes that takes into account time and possible lags in time from one gene in relation to another. We call this method Gene Regulatory Networks on Transfer Entropy (GRNTE) and it corresponds to Granger causality for Gaussian variables in an autoregressive model. To evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of our method, we generated several sub-networks from the GRN of the eukaryotic yeast model, Saccharomyces cerevisae. Then, we applied this method using experimental data of the plant pathogen Phytophthora infestans. We evaluated the transcriptional expression levels of 48 transcription factors of P. infestans during its interaction with one moderately resistant and one susceptible cultivar of yellow potato (Solanum tuberosum group Phureja), using RT-qPCR. With these data, we reconstructed the regulatory network of P. infestans during its interaction with these hosts. Results: We first evaluated the performance of our method, based on the transfer entropy (GRNTE), on eukaryotic datasets from the GRNs of the yeast S. cerevisae. Results suggest that GRNTE is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods when the parameters for edge detection are properly tuned. In the case of P. infestans, most of the genes considered in this study, showed a significant change in expression from the onset of the interaction (0 h post inoculum - hpi) to the later time-points post inoculation. Hierarchical clustering of the expression data discriminated two distinct periods during the infection: from 12 to 36 hpi and from 48 to 72 hpi for both the moderately resistant and susceptible cultivars. These distinct periods could be associated with two phases of the life cycle of the pathogen when infecting the host plant: the biotrophic and necrotrophic phases. Conclusions: Here we presented an algorithmic solution to the problem of network reconstruction in time series data. This analytical perspective makes use of the dynamic nature of time series data as it relates to intrinsically dynamic processes such as transcription regulation, were multiple elements of the cell (e.g., transcription factors) act simultaneously and change over time. We applied the algorithm to study the regulatory network of P. infestans during its interaction with two hosts which differ in their level of resistance to the pathogen. Although the gene expression analysis did not show differences between the two hosts, the results of the GRN analyses evidenced rewiring of the genes' interactions according to the resistance level of the host. This suggests that different regulatory processes are activated in response to different environmental cues. Applications of our methodology showed that it could reliably predict where to place edges in the transcriptional networks and sub-networks. The experimental approach used here can help provide insights on the biological role of these interactions on complex processes such as pathogenicity.

Moreover, the appreciated global resources of biological diversity also occur in tropical areas, such as the Amazon, which is considered one of the chief rain forests and plays a significant role in protection and discovery of novel microbial, plant, and animal species. However, data from tropical regions are scarce. Little is known about the great biodiversity of microorganisms and the application of these resources to improve tropical agriculture. Tropical agriculture presents more problems of greater complexity than agriculture in temperate climates. One approach for solving some agricultural problems in the tropics is sustainable use of microorganisms. Efficient microbes have shown potential in the agricultural field for use in plant development and growth promotion, mostly by delivering valuable compounds to their host plants. Microbial plant growth promoters may improve crop development and growth in numerous biological ways, such as production of secondary metabolites (for example, plant development hormones, including auxins), production of siderophores, phosphate solubilization, and nitrogen fixation. Microorganisms have also received considerable attention because of their potential for use as agents for biological control of various plant fungal pathogens and bacterial diseases. There are numerous processes associated with plant–pathogen hostility. The competition for space and nutrients in the host plant, in the rhizospheric region, and in the soil can be fierce, as can the production of antimicrobial complexes that directly affect plant pathogens. These mainly include lytic enzymes, antibiotics, volatile organic compounds, and other compounds. This review discusses studies on the microorganism diversity that is present in well-established tropical crops, with examples of successful use of microorganisms in solving tropical problems, with the aim being to achieve more sustainable agriculture. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

They have been used in different field applications. In agriculture, they can be found in some phosphate fertilizers at levels one or two orders of magnitude higher than those found in normal agricultural soils. Citrus plants are known to present high levels of REE when compared to most other species, however, there is little information about bioavailability of REE in phosphate fertilizers for citrus plants. This work focuses on the study of REE behavior by the application of increasing doses of single superphosphate fertilizer in Rangpur lime (Citrus limonia Osbeck) plants in a greenhouse study. Methods: The technique used was instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). Results: The results showed that the fertilizer has caused significant increases in the content of REE in the citrus plant tissues, with higher concentrations in leaves than in branches. The highest substrate-leaf transfer factor was observed for La (0.0047), though the concentrations in the plants followed the same order found in the substrate, i.e. Ce > La > Sm > Eu > Sc. Conclusion: There was an increase of rare earth elements concentrations in Rangpur lime plants by superphosphate fertilizer application. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	Article	Scopus

However, the degree of change and the main influencing factors appear to vary considerably. To characterize this process in a continuum of slave-remnant villages (Kalunga) in the Brazilian Cerrado, we assessed (i) the main influencing factors of this shift in food patterns and (ii) the isotopic composition (δ13C and δ15 N) in the fingernails of inhabitants. The stable isotope ratios from the fingernails of 87 volunteers from different Kalunga villages were used to determine the source and trophic chain diversity of food. In addition, we conducted semi-structured questionnaire interviews in 81 domestic units to verify details about food patterns, use of resources, and socioeconomic conditions. Data from the questionnaires were analyzed using a multinomial logistic regression to determine the relative influence of multiple factors on the transition process. From this, access to town and government subsidies was significantly associated with the reduction of subsistence farming and the consumption of staple foods like rice and beans. We also verified a gradual food change from C3 (more natural) to C4 (more processed) sources of food containing a smaller diversity items with an increase of δ13C and decrease of δ15 N toward the town. These results primarily indicate a transition pattern from locally produced foods to processed items that increases with greater urban access and more government subsidies in rural settings. This is the first time that an interdisciplinary approach with stable isotopes and one multinomial discriminant model has been used to assess the impacts of public policy and socioeconomic development on the livelihood of slave-remnant communities. The main issue raised here concerns the maintenance of food sovereignty in rural areas for residents who essentially live by their own efforts and livelihoods. © 2019, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

Belmonte subjected to grazing regimes	2019	Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment	278			96	106	10	10.1016/j.agee.2019.02.016	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064647635&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2019.02.016&partnerID=40&md5=41792c2651dd5c89c5224b6222036264	Productivity of grassland ecosystems is highly dependent on the availability of nitrogen (N) from the soil and/or biological fixation (BNF) from the atmosphere. However, the high cost of N-fertilizers and the increasing awareness of the need for sustainable nutrient alternative sources have increased the strategic importance of the BNF. Defoliation interferes with plant growth and also with BNF in legumes, since it modifies the leaf area and the availability of energy to plants. In spite of the potential advantages of forage legumes to pastures, current knowledge regarding the effects of grazing management on BNF is scarce. In order to evaluate the effect of grazing management on aerial and root mass, nodulation and BNF in forage peanut (Arachis pintoi cv. Belmonte), two experimental protocols based on the continuous and intermittent (rotational grazing) stocking methods were used. In the continuous stocking protocol, treatments corresponded to four grazing intensities represented by four management heights - 5, 10, 15 and 20 cm. In the intermittent stocking protocol, treatments corresponded to combinations between two pre- (95% and maximum canopy light interception during regrowth – LI95% and LIMax, respectively) and two post-grazing (post-grazing heights equivalent to 40 and 60% of the pre-grazing height) conditions. It was hypothesized that hard grazing, represented by low management heights under continuous stocking or low post-grazing heights under intermittent stocking, causes reduction in root mass and nodulation interfering with the balance between root and aerial, with negative impacts on BNF. Under continuous stocking, greater number of nodules was associated with lower nodule mass and vice-versa throughout the year. Swards managed at 5 and 10 cm had greater root and nodule mass than those managed at 15 and 20 cm. However, greater BNF (%Ndfa and BNF) was recorded on swards managed at 15 and 20 cm relative to those managed at 5 and 10 cm. Under intermittent stocking, the combinations between frequencies and severities of grazing did not affect root mass or nodule number at both pre- and post-grazing conditions. Overall, swards managed with the LIMax target showed greater BNF than those managed with the LI95% target. For swards managed with the same LI target (LI95% or LIMax), hard grazing (40% of the pre-grazing height) resulted in lower %Ndfa and BNF during early and late spring and summer II. For both grazing methods, the range of management targets used did not result in negative impacts on root mass or nodulation. Regardless of grazing method, BNF was determined by aerial biomass, indicating that moderate intensities of grazing would be adequate for optimizing BNF. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

The membrane-bound enzyme alternative oxidase (AOX) is critical for M. perniciosa virulence and resistance to fungicides, which has also been observed in other phytopathogens. Notably AOX is an escape mechanism from strobilurins and other respiration inhibitors, making AOX a promising target for controlling WBD and other fungal diseases. Results: We present the first study aimed at developing novel fungal AOX inhibitors. N-Phenylbenzamide (NPD) derivatives were screened in the model yeast Pichia pastoris through oxygen consumption and growth measurements. The most promising AOX inhibitor (NPD 7j-41) was further characterized and displayed better activity than the classical AOX inhibitor SHAM in vitro against filamentous fugal phytopathogens, such as M. perniciosa, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Venturia pirina. We demonstrate that 7j-41 inhibits M. perniciosa spore germination and prevents WBD symptom appearance in infected plants. Finally, a structural model of P. pastoris AOX was created and used in ligand structure-activity relationships analyses. Conclusion: We present novel fungal AOX inhibitors with antifungal activity against relevant phytopathogens. We envisage the development of novel antifungal agents to secure food production. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry	Article	Scopus

This study investigates changes in the urine metabolome following acute intake of polyphenol-rich juice, purple grumixama juice. Grumixama (Eugenia brasiliensis Lam.) is a cherry native to Brazil that is known to be a rich source of anthocyanins and ellagitannins. In this research 15 healthy subjects consumed a single dose of grumixama juice. Urine samples were collected before grumixama juice intake, 0–1, 1–2, 2–4 h, with fasting at 24 h after intake. Plasma samples were also collected before intake, 30′ and at 1 h, 2 h and 4 h, with fasting at 24 h after juice intake. The urine primary metabolites were analysed by a metabolomic approach using gas chromatography mass spectrometry with methyl chloroformate derivatisation for amino acids and organic acids. Also, an oxygen radical absorbance capacity method was carried out to evaluate the plasma samples antioxidant capacity changes. Subjects showed increase in plasma antioxidant capacity after juice intake (p-values < .05). A total of 114 metabolites were assessed in urine (1–2 h and 2–4 h), including 17 amino acids, 47 organic acids and several other metabolites. Among the 114 metabolites, 25 were significantly changed during the first 4 h following juice intake, as shown by the Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (0.5 > p(corr) > 0.3) and univariate analysis (p-values < .05). Some metabolites were related to mitochondrial metabolism, such as glyoxylic acid and oxalic acid. Metabolites related to amino acid metabolism were also changed, such as beta-alanine, L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine. In conclusion, results suggest that acute intake of grumixama juice could affect amino acid metabolism and mitochondrial metabolism, but the related health implications should be explored in further studies using additional approaches. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

The chemical composition of the EO with the highest activity and its effects on the morphology of the pathogen were verified. The in vivo antifungal activity of this EO associated with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) coating, in preventive and curative applications, was also evaluated. L. sidoides EO presented the highest antifungal activity in vitro, being more efficient by direct contact than by volatilization. This EO has a predominance of the compound thymol and was able to cause dehydration and rupture of the pathogen hyphae. In vivo, strawberries treated with CMC associated with L. sidoides EO presented a reduction in disease severity, when treated in a curative way. Thus, the association of L. sidoides EO with CMC can be a potential alternative for the control of this disease. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Eighteen six-month-old Santa Inês male lambs (18.9 ± 2.4 kg of body weight (BW)) were used. Animals were assigned to two treatments according to their sexual condition: uncastrated (U) or castrated (C). During a 98-day experimental period, animals were kept on an Andropogon gayanus grass pasture area of 1 ha and supplemented with 200 g/animal/day of concentrate mixture. Water and mineral salt were available ad libitum. The lambs were weighed fortnightly, and at the last day of the trial, they were slaughtered for evaluation of carcass characteristics and fatty acids profile of perirenal fat and longissimus lumborum muscle samples. Castrated lambs showed higher BW than U during most part of the experiment (p < 0.05). Fat deposition was higher in C lambs as evidenced by their increased carcass fat cover. Meat from U lambs showed lower content of C                             16:0                              and higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (p < 0.05) than that from C (U, 14.3 and C, 10.5%). Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content was not affected by castration (p > 0.05) (U, 0.74 and C, 0.76%). The cis-9, cis-12 C                             18:2n-6                              (U, 10.6 and C, 6.86%) fatty acid and the PUFA:SFA (saturated fatty acids) ratio (U, 0.36 and C, 0.25) were higher in the muscle of U lambs (p < 0.05), indicating that the meat from U animals may provide more benefits to human health than that of C.                          © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

The objective of this study was to gain insight into the influence of this management on soil physical properties and root growth associated with sugarcane water availability. A three-year experiment on a sandy-clay haplustox was used for the assessment of water retention, bulk density, porosity, pressure head, temperature and plant response (yield and root system). Soil carbon stocks were also assessed in the soil profile. The treatments compared of conventional tillage (CT), which consisted of a 0.3 m ploughing followed by two disking graders with 20″ discs and one light disking leveler grade, and DT, a subsoiler rod (0.8 m deep) with a rotary hoe with 16 knives to raise crop seedbed in rows. Our results reveal that DT resulted in lower bulk density and higher total porosity values than CT in most cases for the surface soil layers. Moreover, while the soil water relations did not show significant difference for total water availability, the soil water pressure head monitoring indicated a trend of more negative values under CT management, i.e., a drier condition. Additionally, DT resulted in better root system development referring to root density and root length density. However, DT resulted in lower sugarcane yield. The experiment was carried out under rainfed conditions, but rainfall distribution did not limit sugarcane production. Therefore, under the mild water stress conditions as observed in this study, the observed root biomass increase did not favor sugarcane yield. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

To reach these goals, the hydrological processes were monitored during 2008 and 2009. The surface runoff, groundwater, streamflow, precipitation, net precipitation and soil water storage at 0.15m, 0.30m, 0.50m and 0.90m, were monitored through nine 2.25 m2 plots, tensiometer, tipping-bucket rain gauges, trough-type collectors and H-flume, respectively. Aiming to clarify the soil hydrological processes, the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured in the field at the depths of water storage measurements using a constant head permeameter. For 2008, the annual precipitation (P) was 1716 mm. Interception losses accounted for 33% of the annual precipitation. The runoff coefficient was 40% of annual rainfall. For 2009, annual precipitation was 3003 mm. Approximately 32% of rainfall was intercepted. Runoff coefficient was 48% of annual rainfall. The predominance of low rainfall intensity (0 - 5 mm h-1) substantially below the Ksat median at 0.15 m allowed us to infer that the soil accommodates the majority of the rain events. This inference is corroborated by low surface runoff coefficients. The higher precipitation in 2009 caused a significant increase in throughfall, surface runoff, a daily flow relative to 2008, showing the temporal variability that high precipitation years promote on the hydrologic dynamic of catchments covered by the Atlantic Rainforest. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

We implemented an experimental and numerical protocol to obtain K-θ-h of eleven soils with a broad spectrum of texture and land use. Measurements of the soil water content during evaporation experiments using gamma-ray beam attenuation, a non-invasive technique, were adopted as an alternative approach to conventional measurements of the soil water pressure head. Inverse parameter optimization was performed using Hydrus-1D. The optimized K-θ-h functions were interpreted with respect to crop available water, where results calculated by a proposed “dynamic” method were compared with those determined using the conventional “static” criteria with standardized pressure heads. The evaporation experiment protocol allowed the determination of the K-θ-h relationships by inverse modeling from near-saturation to the dry range (∼ −150 m) with satisfactory accuracy. Soil water retention curves of the fine-textured soils determined by the conventional method (pressure plates) deviated from those estimated by the inverse optimization near saturation and in the dry range, with the conventional method predicting larger water content values. In terms of crop available water, the “dynamic” method allowed incorporating system characteristics (atmospheric demand and crop properties) and K-θ-h in a process-based way, contrarily to the “static” method. Considering a specific scenario, for the fine-textured soils the “static” and “dynamic” approaches performed similarly, however, for the coarse-textured soils, they diverged significantly. No tendency could be revealed for crop water availability under different land uses, and, in general, crop available water for soils under forest use was very similar to their counterparts under agricultural use. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of P × Zn interactions in a modern cultivar of cotton grown hydroponically. Biomass, mineral nutrition and photosynthetic parameters were monitored in plants receiving contrasting combinations of P and Zn supply. Root biomass, length and surface area were similar in plants with low P and/or low Zn supply to those in plants grown with high P and high Zn supply, reflecting an increased root/shoot biomass quotient when plants lack sufficient P or Zn for growth. Increasing P supply and reducing Zn supply increased shoot P concentrations, whilst shoot Zn concentrations were influenced largely by Zn supply. A balanced P × Zn supply (4 mM P × 4 μM Zn) enabled greatest biomass accumulation, while an imbalanced supply of these nutrients led to Zn deficiency, P toxicity or Zn toxicity. Net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency increased as P or Zn supply increased. Although increasing P supply reduced the P-use efficiency in photosynthesis (PUEP) and increasing Zn supply reduced the Zn-use efficiency in photosynthesis (ZnUEP), increasing Zn supply at a given P supply increased PUEP and increasing P supply at a given Zn supply increased ZnUEP. These results suggest that agricultural management strategies should seek for balanced mineral nutrition to optimize yields and resource-use efficiencies. © 2018 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society	Article	Scopus

Information on genetic features and accurate distribution of pests is the basis for agricultural protection policies. Furthermore, such knowledge is imperative to develop control strategies, understand the geographical range, and genetic patterns of this species in the Americas. Here, we carried out the widest sampling of H. armigera in the South American continent and Puerto Rico, after we estimated the diversity, demographic parameters, and genetic structure. The Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) nuclear marker was used to investigate the presence of putative hybrids between H. armigera and H. zea, and they were observed at a frequency of 1.5%. An ABC analysis, based in COI gene fragment, suggested Europe as the origin of South America specimens of H. armigeraand following a movement northward through the Caribbean. Three mtDNA genes and three nDNA markers revealed high genetic diversity distributed without the defined population structure of H. armigera in South America. Most of the genetic variation is within populations with a multidirectional expansion of H. armigera among morphoclimatic regions. High genetic diversity, rapid population expansion, and hybridization have implications for pest management since they suggest that adaptive alleles are spread through wide areas in South America that favor rapid local adaptation of H. armigera to new and disturbed environments (e.g., in agricultural areas). © 2019 The Authors.

Here, As and Cd were determined by ICP-MS and species of As by HPLC-ICP-MS in Brazilian husked rice, covering diverse cultivars and regions, as well as upland and flooded production systems. Significant differences were observed for contents of both elements according to the origin of rice. All samples were below the maximum limit for Cd (400 µg/kg) set by national legislation, while nine samples presented total As above the legislation limit (300 µg/kg). From 24 samples analyzed for As species, 42% showed iAs above the European limit for production of food to infants (100 µg/kg). The total As content in samples from Mato Grosso state presented a maximum value of 6 µg/kg, which combined with low Cd content make interesting further studies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Simulation of intercropped plants with integrated soil-plant-atmosphere models is a challenging procedure due to the requirement of a second spatial dimension for calculating the soil water lateral flux. Evaluations of more straightforward approaches for intercrop modeling are, therefore, mandatory. An adaptation of the 1D model Soil, Water, Atmosphere and Plant coupled to the World Food Studies (SWAP/WOFOST) to simulate intercropping (SWAP 2x1D) based on solar radiation and water partitioning between plant strips was developed and the outcomes are presented. An application of SWAP 2x1D to maize-soybean (MS) strip intercropping was evaluated against the monocropping maize (M) and soybean (S) simulated with the 1D model SWAP/WOFOST, and a sensitivity analysis of SWAP 2x1D was carried out for the intercropping MS. SWAP 2x1D was able to simulate the radiation interception by both crops in the intercropping MS and also to determine the effect of the radiation attenuation by maize on soybean plants. Intercropped plants presented higher transpiration and resulted in lower soil evaporation when compared to their equivalent monocropping cultivation. A numerical issue involving model instability caused by the simulated lateral water flux in the soil from one strip to the other was solved. The most sensitive plant parameters were those related to the taller plant strips in the intercropping, and soil retention curve parameters were overall all significantly sensitive for the water balance simulation. This implementation of the SWAP model presents an opportunity to simulate strip intercropping with a limited number of parameters, including the partitioning of radiation by a well-validated radiation sharing model and of soil water by simulating the lateral soil water fluxes between strips in the 2x1D environment. © 2019 by the authors.

Sources and sinks of Si in these ecosystems are directly dependent on pedogenesis and are strongly influenced by the readily soluble Si components, such as dissolved Si, adsorbed Si, and amorphous silicates. The aim of this study was to identify and assess the distribution of readily soluble Si pool in two HTFs on the Brazilian coast. We based our studies on sequential extractions of iron and silicon, modeling of the soil aqueous phase, and X-ray diffraction of the fine clay fraction. Our results show that mobile Si and adsorbed Si are present at very low levels in HTF soils, comprising <3% of the readily soluble Si pool. Silicon associated with Fe oxyhydroxides is the second largest component of the readily soluble Si pool, making up 8.7–40.8% of the Si extractions. The correlation between the ferrihydrite fraction and Si associated with Fe oxyhydroxides indicates a large control of Si by ferrihydrite. Amorphous Si makes up the dominant fraction, comprising 59–90% of the Si extractions. SEM images show the presence of diatoms, sponges, and phytoliths in the soils. Precipitation of pedogenic opal seems to occur in the soils due to a dry season at both sites. The clay assemblages are composed of the mixed-layer kaolinite-smectite (K-S), kaolinite-illite (K-I), and illite-smectite (I-S), and lesser amounts of kaolinite (K) and smectite (S) end-members. The presence of these clays indicates that HTF soils are conducive to the formation of mixed-layer minerals, which partially control Si dynamics. Our data indicate that HTF soils tend to accumulate Si by adsorption, (co)precipitation, and reactions involving clay minerals. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Many of the world's sustainability targets hinge on global nitrogen solutions, which, in turn, contribute lasting benefits for (i) world hunger; (ii) soil, air, and water quality; (iii) climate change mitigation; and (iv) biodiversity conservation. Balancing the projected rise in agricultural nitrogen demands while achieving these 21st century ideals will require policies to coordinate solutions among technologies, consumer choice, and socioeconomic transformation. ©2019.

This is the largest member of the Ommastrephidae family and grows to 2 m in length, making it one of the largest luminescent animals ever observed. Humboldt squid have small photophores all over their body that emit a brilliant blue luminescence. Using lyophilized photophores from squid caught off the coast of Chile, experiments were conducted to isolate the luciferin and protein involved in its bioluminescence. Methanolic extracts of the photophores were shown to contain dehydrocoelenterazine, and a membrane-bound photoprotein was shown to be involved. This photoprotein was purified using ion exchange chromatography, and SDS-PAGE showed a clean band of approximately 60 kDa. The excised band was analyzed by LC/MS, and the obtained data were compared against the transcriptome data of D. gigas, allowing us to find two gene products which displayed high coverage (>80%), the enzymes symplectin and vanin-2, which potentially associate with light emission process in this organism. Finally, the purified photoprotein was shown to emit a blue light (470 nm) in the presence of dehydrocoelenterazine. © 2019 American Society for Photobiology	Article	Scopus

EPA is an important and expensive dietary supplement with a promising and very competitive market, which is dependent on fish-oil extraction. This has prompted several research groups to study biotechnological routes to obtain specific fatty acids rather than a mixture of various lipids. Moreover, microorganisms can use low cost carbon sources for lipid production, thus reducing production costs. Previous studies have highlighted the production of EPA by P. irregulare, exploiting diverse low cost carbon sources that are produced in large amounts, such as vinasse, glycerol, and food wastewater. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about its biosynthetic pathways, because no functional annotation of any Pythium sp. exists yet. The goal of this work was to identify key genes and pathways related to EPA biosynthesis, in P. irregulare CBS 494.86, by sequencing and performing an unprecedented annotation of its genome, considering the possibility of using wastewater as a carbon source. Results: Genome sequencing provided 17,727 candidate genes, with 3809 of them associated with enzyme code and 945 with membrane transporter proteins. The functional annotation was compared with curated information of oleaginous organisms, understanding amino acids and fatty acids production, and consumption of carbon and nitrogen sources, present in the wastewater. The main features include the presence of genes related to the consumption of several sugars and candidate genes of unsaturated fatty acids production. Conclusions: The whole metabolic genome presented, which is an unprecedented reconstruction of P. irregulare CBS 494.86, shows its potential to produce value-added products, in special EPA, for food and pharmaceutical industries, moreover it infers metabolic capabilities of the microorganism by incorporating information obtained from literature and genomic data, supplying information of great importance to future work. © 2019 The Author(s).

In this study, there was evaluation of the effects of gossypol by culturing granulosa cells and oocytes in ewe ovarian tissues. Ovarian tissues were cultured with gossypol at 37 °C, in humidified air and 5% CO                             2                             . Variables that were evaluated were morphology, morphometry, ultrastructure and abundance of estradiol receptor α (α-ER). There were no differences in developmental characteristics when there was treatment with any of the gossypol doses that were evaluated. Immunostaining indicated that when the gossypol dose increases, the abundance of α-ER also increases in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and granulosa cells. Findings with the ultrastructural analysis indicated that for granulosa cells there was fewer cells and greater disorganization and a lack of structural integrity of follicular cell layers as a result of all gossypol treatments. The culture of oocytes in preantral ovarian follicles in presence of gossypol did not affect the morphological-metric structure at the doses evaluated. The findings with evaluation of ultrastructural and immunohistochemical structures indicated granulosa cells and α-ER were affected by the treatments with gossypol indicating there were effects of this compound on ovarian function in sheep. This study indicated there is a toxic action of gossypol when using the biotechnology, MOEPF. Thus, gossypol negatively affects granulosa cell development and structural integrity of preantral follicles in sheep.                          © 2018	Article	Scopus

Samples were collected to study palynological groups, sedimentary facies, and geochemistry analyses (δ                             13                             C, δ                             15                             N, TOC, TN, C:N ratio, TS, and C:S ratio), synchronized with four radiocarbon ages. The main result of this research was the mangrove succession, divided into three palynological zones composing two facies association: (1) herbaceous tidal flat and (2) mangrove tidal flat. The first zone between at least ~1815 and ~1629 cal. yr BP was marked by the mangrove absence with marine particulate organic carbon, C                             3                              terrestrial plants, and macrophytes organic matter influence with δ                             13                             C values between −26.7‰ and −20‰, δ                             15                             N values x̅ = 3.5‰ and C:N around 21.8. The second zone between ~1629 and ~853 cal. yr BP was marked by the mangrove establishment represented only by Laguncularia pollen under influence of estuarine organic matter (δ                             13                             C x̅ = −26.5‰; δ                             15                             N x̅ = 3.2‰, and C:N around 16.4). The third zone reveals an increase of Laguncularia and presence of Avicennia pollen since ~853 cal. yr BP. Near the surface (<10 cm) occurs Rhizophora pollen, indicating the establishment of this genus during the past decades, under the modern environmental condition (δ                             13                             C x̅ = −27.02‰; δ                             15                             N x̅ = 3.12‰, and C:N around 17.42). This mangrove vertical succession may be associated with the low-temperature tolerance, where the sequence Rhizophora, Avicennia, and Laguncularia occurs from the northern to the southern limits of Santa Catarina coast, respectively, reflecting the temperature gradient. Therefore, probably, the establishment of the mangrove assemblage identified along the studied pollen profile was influenced by a temperature increase of air and water during the late-Holocene and, considering the Rhizophora genus, only during the past decades.                          © The Author(s) 2018.

In these soils, the residual effects can represent a neglected phenomenon, since silvicultural management experiences a longer crop rotation cycle compared to most common agricultural cycles. Consequently, under forestry management, sewage sludge applications can represent an event occurring just once over cycles of several years. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of residual sewage sludge application in infertile tropical soils under Eucalyptus plantations in terms of both the main chemical features (pH, soil organic matter, N, P, S, K, Ca, Mg, and cation-exchange capacity) and the potentially toxic elements (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn) concentrations/behaviors of soil. Residual effects were evaluated in four areas (São Paulo State, Brazil) after 10.0, 12.2, 12.4, and 17.2 years from the first and only application, respectively. Differences in terms of treatments were evaluated by analysis of variance; correlations and similarity analyzed by principal component and cluster analysis, respectively. The results showed that soil organic matter, main macronutrients (N and P), and cation-exchange capacity contents were generally higher in sewage sludge-treated soils while potentially toxic element contents tended to increase at increasing sewage sludge doses. In most of the investigated treatments, the potentially toxic element concentrations were usually below both the soil natural background concentrations and quality reference values. Principal component and cluster analysis revealed that differences among areas were primary due to differences in applied sewage sludge type and amount. The effects of residual sewage sludge application on soil, in terms of both the pros and cons, can be detected even many years after the first and only application. Studies on the long-term effects of sewage sludge should be mandatory for both monitoring the pedoenvironment and for guiding policymakers and producers on the best practices for their reuse and management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Abstract: Citrus fruits are rich in carotenoids; the genus offers a large diversity in composition, yet to be fully explored to improve fruit nutritional quality. As perennial tree species, Citrus lack the resources for functional genetic studies, requiring the use of model plant systems. Here, we used the “Micro-Tom” (MT) tomato carrying the tangerine mutation (t), deficient for the carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO) gene, to functionally characterize the homologous C. sinensis genes. We identified four putative loci in the C. sinensis genome, named CsCRTISO, CsCRTISO-Like 1, CsCRTISO-Like 2, and CsCRTISO-Like 2B, with the latter as a presumed duplication of CRTISO-Like 2. In general, all the Citrus paralogs showed less expression specialization than the tomato ones, with CsCRTISO being the most expressed gene in all tissues analyzed. MT-t plants were successfully complemented with the CsCRTISO, and fruits showed a carotenoid profile similar to the control, indicating that the Citrus allele indeed encodes an authentic functional carotenoid isomerase and that the signal peptide is functional in tomato. MT was silenced using an inverted repeat of a fragment from the Citrus CRTISO resulting in a stronger phenotype than MT-t. MT-t and MT silenced for CRTISO presented an overall decrease in transcript accumulation of all genes from the biosynthesis pathway. The expression of the Citrus CRTISO gene is able to restore the biosynthesis of carotenoids with the appropriate regulation in MT-t. The decrease in transcript accumulation in MT-t and MT-CRTISO-suppressed lines reinforces previous suggestions that transcriptional regulation of the carotenoid biosynthesis involves regulatory loops by intermediate products. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The experiment was conducted on a Typic Hapludox in the first and second sugarcane ratoons. The treatments consisted of four N doses (50, 100, 150, and 200 kg ha-1) applied as ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), besides a control, without the application of N. The increase in the NH4Cl dose increased in up to three times soil electrical conductivity in the layer of 0.0-0.2 m, with a consequent increase in the concentration of chlorine in leaves. In the second cycle, the contents of chlorine increased in 1,900 mg kg-1 in the leaf with the application of 200 mg kg-1 NH4Cl, when compared with the control. In the first cycle, the application of NH4Cl doses above 200 kg ha-1 N promoted a decrease in shoot productivity. In both cycles, there was no effect of the NH4Cl doses on root dry matter. High doses of NH4Cl, in consecutive sugarcane cycles, result in a decrease in the productivity of stalks for processing. © 2018, Revista Pro-Fono.	Article	Scopus

To assess the extent of this effect, an outdoor experiment was conducted in which common bean plants received five treatments: fully irrigated, and irrigation deficits of 30% and 50% applied in flowering or pod formation stages onwards. Evapotranspiration, number and length of pods, shoot biomass, grain yield and harvest index were assessed, and architectural traits (length and thickness of internodes, length of petioles and petiolules, length and width of leaflet blades and angles) were recorded and analyzed using regression models. The highest irrigation deficit in the flowering stage had the most pronounced effect on plant architecture. Stressed plants were shorter, leaves were smaller and pointing downward, indicating that plants permanently altered their exposure to sunlight. The combined effect of irrigation deficit and less exposure to light lead to shorter pods, less shoot biomass and lower grain yield. Fitted empirical models between water deficit and plant architecture can be included in architectural simulation models to quantify plant light interception under water stress, which, in turn, can supply crop models adding a second order of water stress effects on crop yield simulation. © 2019 by the authors.

However, information regarding the effects of global climate change on the stoichiometry of tropical pastures is lacking, especially under field conditions. Such information is crucial to understand how temperature conditions and water availability states are likely to affect the stoichiometric homeostasis and biomass production of Panicum maximum, an important C4 tropical forage species, under future climate change scenarios. Thus, we, conducted a field experiment using a temperature free-air controlled enhancement system and evaluated the effects of two temperature conditions, ambient temperature and moderate warming (2 °C above ambient canopy temperature), and two levels of water availability, irrigated and non-irrigated, on the stoichiometric patterns of C:N:P and leaf biomass production. The experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design in a factorial arrangement with four replications over 3 weeks. Our findings revealed that the N and P leaf concentration greatly decreased in water-stressed plants, which increased the C:N and C:P ratios, while warming increased the N:P ratio. Leaf biomass production was impaired by up to 16% under water stress and ambient temperature conditions, but the biomass production was improved by 20% under warming and irrigated conditions. Our findings showed that homeostatic instability under rainfed conditions resulted in decreased leaf biomass production. Therefore, we concluded that warming is only beneficial for plant growth (i.e., a high homeostatic capacity was maintained) under well-irrigated conditions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Despite the fact that legume cover crops have the potential to increase soil quality and sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) yield, much information is still needed to determine amount of N available from cover crops to sequential ratoon cycles. This study was designed to assess the impacts of sunn hemp (Crotalaria spectabilis) cover crop on soil N dynamics and sugarcane ratoon response to N fertilization during two harvest seasons across three contrasting soil and climatic conditions in southern Brazil. The treatments consisted of cover crop and fallow established prior to sugarcane replanting; in addition to three N-fertilizer rates 60, 120 and 180 kg N ha                             −1                              and a 0-N control applied during the first and second ratoons.

Cover crop with sunn hemp increased the accumulated two-year yields by 14–25 Mg ha                             −1                              at all sites and NUE (Mg stalks kg                             −1                              N) across all N rates at two sites. Our findings support the conclusion that cover crop did not change the N requirement of succeeding ratoon crops but increases the yield, thereby improving NUE in sugarcane systems.                          © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

It pioneering exploits the influence of ethanol concentration on the radiation absorption by phenolphthalein in alkaline medium. This effect is attributed to the low dielectric constant of ethanol in comparison with water, which affects the resonance structures of the phthaleins and the closure of the lactone ring. The color intensity was measured and converted to RGB values with a smartphone by using a free application (App). Aiming at portability, an innovative holder was built in a 3D printer; it integrated the smartphone and the measurement microtube to ensure the analytical measurements under proper focal distance and illumination provided by the smartphone camera. The procedure showed a linear response from 10.0 to 70.0% (v/v) ethanol (r = 0.998, n = 7), a coefficient of variation of 1.2% (n = 8) and a limit of detection (99.7% confidence level) estimated at 2.1% (v/v). Accuracy was assessed by comparison of the results achieved by the proposed and the AOAC reference procedures, which agreed at the 95% confidence level. The proposed procedure is practical, fast (<1 min per determination), environmentally friendly (only 10.8 μg phenolphthalein is required per determination), and suitable for point-of-care determination of ethanol in distilled beverages. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

By contrast, the diterpene hormone gibberellin (GA) and the microRNA319-regulated TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) transcription factors promote flowering in the facultative long-day Arabidopsis thaliana, but suppress it in the day-neutral tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). We combined genetic and molecular studies and described a new interplay between GA and two unrelated miRNA-associated pathways that modulates tomato transition to flowering. Tomato PROCERA/DELLA activity is required to promote flowering along with the miR156-targeted SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING–LIKE (SPL/SBP) transcription factors by activating SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT) in the leaves and the MADS-Box gene APETALA1(AP1)/MC at the shoot apex. Conversely, miR319-targeted LANCEOLATE represses floral transition by increasing GA concentrations and inactivating SFT in the leaves and AP1/MC at the shoot apex. Importantly, the combination of high GA concentrations/responses with the loss of SPL/SPB function impaired canonical meristem maturation and flower initiation in tomato. Our results reveal a cooperative regulation of tomato floral induction and flower development, integrating age cues (miR156 module) with GA responses and miR319-controlled pathways. Importantly, this study contributes to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of GA in controlling flowering time in a day-neutral species. © 2018 The Authors.

Bone char (BC) has been shown to strongly sorb organic compounds and could be used as a sorbent to increase herbicide sorption and decrease leaching, although the better form of application is not known. The aim of this research was to assess the effect of cow BC on the sorption-desorption and mobility of hexazinone, metribuzin, and quinclorac applied to a sandy loam tropical soil under laboratory conditions. The methodology of the sorption-desorption studies was established using a batch equilibrium method, and the treatments were unamended soil, pure BC, and BC-amended soil (at a rate of 5% by weight). Herbicide mobility studies were evaluated by column leaching and soil thin-layer chromatography (TLC). In the column leaching studies, BC was either applied to the surface or incorporated into the 0–10 cm top layer of soil, the latter at a rate of 5% by weight (60 t ha                             −1                             ). A glass column was prepared for each treatment, and analyses of                              14                             C-herbicides were performed by liquid scintillation counting. Finally, for TLC studies the BC treatments were unamended soil, BC (5% by weight)-amended soil, soil + BC band (1 cm) in the middle, and soil + BC band at the top. We conclude that cow BC is an excellent sorbent to reduce mobility of hexazinone, metribuzin, and quinclorac in a tropical soil through the high sorption of these herbicides, regardless of application form of the material. Thus, it is possible to minimize the pollution of soil-applied herbicide simultaneously, as the BC and thus the herbicides can remain in the soil for a long time.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, in this study, we isolated and identified by partial 16S RNA sequencing ∼100 actinobacteria isolates from guarana (Paullinia cupana) bulk soil. Besides, we isolated from the actinobacteria Streptomyces morookaense AM25 a novel cyclic peptide, named gloeosporiocide, molecular formula C44H48N11O7S3 (calculated 938.2901), and characterized by the presence of cyclized cysteins to form three thiazols. The novel compound had activity against the plant pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, assayed by the paper disk diffusion method (42.7% inhibition, 0.1 mg disk-1) and by the microdilution assay (1.25 g L-1). Our results reveal the potential of the actinobacteria from the Amazon rhizospheric soils as biocontrol agents as well as producers of new compounds with antifungal activity. Thus, this work constitutes a step forward in the development of the biotechnology of actinobacteria in the production of compounds of agronomic interest. © 2019 FEMS.	Article	Scopus

Practices of application or maintenance of soil organic residues that have begun to be used in agriculture for soil nutrition have demonstrated other benefits besides nutrient supplementation, such as reduced mobility and increased soil degradation of herbicides. Because it is the final destination of herbicides, soil and its constituents, especially organic matter in tropical soils, play a prominent role in processes that encompass the dynamics of herbicide molecules. In this context, it is necessary to know the influence of the organic matter and its constituents on the behavior of the herbicides. This review discusses the main relationships of organic matter in the retention, transport, and transformation processes of herbicides in the soil, as well as the interference in the weed control effectiveness of these products. Because of this, knowing the influence of organic matter in the various processes related to the behavior of herbicides in the soil allows us to adopt more appropriate management practices regarding both weed control and remediation of contaminated areas. However, despite the wide range of information on the subject in the literature, each situation is distinct due to the wide variation in the behavioral response of the products to the different types of organic material present in the soil. © 2019, Sociedade Brasileira da Ciencia das Plantas Daninha.

However, consequences of this nutrient in the progeny is not well characterized. Thus, this work evaluated the effect on the immune and antioxidant status of the progeny of feeding Santa Ines ewe with or without cottonseed. Twenty-four Santa Ines ewes were distributed in two feeding regimes: cottonseed (CS) concentrate (n = 12) and soybean (SB) concentrate (n = 12). After birth, lambs remained with their mothers and blood samples were collected at 1                             st                             , 3                             rd                             , 7                             th                             , 15                             th                             , 30                             th                              and 60                             th                              day of life of 24 lambs born from mothers fed with (CS, n = 12) or without (SB, n = 12) cottonseed. Serum total protein, albumin, alpha beta globulin, gamma globulin, immunoglobulin G and M, activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and variables related to iron metabolism were affected only by sampling times (P < 0.05). The concentration of serum total protein, alpha beta globulin, gamma globulin and immunoglobulin G and M, GPx activity and ORAC values decreased as lamb age increased. Serum albumin concentration and CAT activity, in turn, increased as lamb age increased. In this work, maternal feeding with cottonseed did not affect the serum protein profile and antioxidant status of progeny during the lactation period, indicating no transfer of gossypol effects by milk secretions. Thus, the alternative in ruminants feeding with cottonseed can be used without maternal-descendant effects to immunity and oxidative stress in lambs.                          © 2018 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

This study, it was hypothesized that the availability of P in the different forms extracted sequentially, would vary according to the land use, and its exchange would depend on its chemical characteristics. For this purpose, sequential extraction and isotopic dilution techniques were utilized to measure the effect of land use systems and corresponding P fertilizer inputs on size of inorganic and organic P forms and their lability. An Andisol sample from a field site with a long history of P amendments and another sample from a contiguous forested area under natural vegetation were treated with applied KH232PO4. The soil samples were sequentially extracted for P fractions after 49 days (d) of incubation. Recovery of 32P in each P form was evaluated. The recovery of 32P in all soil P fractions exhibited that 32P had undergone exchange with the native P. The exchange reaction occurred mainly in the Pi fractions. Resin-Pi, Bic-Pi and NaOH-Pi were increased by P fertilization, with the greater level occurring for NaOH-Pi. The highest increase of the 32P recovered in the NaOH0.1-Pi fraction of the P-fertilized Andisol shows that the added P changed into this form stays highly exchangeable and contributes P fertility to this soil type. The recalcitrant inorganic fractions contained almost no exchangeable P. In contrast, in native soil with no P input, more than 20% of the 32P was recovered in Bic-Po and NaOH-Po forms 49 d after the labeled P was added. The change in soil P fraction was associated with soil type and P addition. Nonetheless, the applied P persisting in the fraction can be exchangeable with solution P and, hence, can be plant-available. © 2020 Journal of the Pakistan Medical Association Academic Press.

However, until recently, fine-scale observations critical to revealing ecological mechanisms underlying these changes have been lacking. To investigate fine-scale variation in leaf area with seasonality and drought we conducted monthly ground-based LiDAR surveys over 4 yr at an Amazon forest site. We analysed temporal changes in vertically structured LAI along axes of both canopy height and light environments. Upper canopy LAI increased during the dry season, whereas lower canopy LAI decreased. The low canopy decrease was driven by highly illuminated leaves of smaller trees in gaps. By contrast, understory LAI increased concurrently with the upper canopy. Hence, tree phenological strategies were stratified by height and light environments. Trends were amplified during a 2015–2016 severe El Niño drought. Leaf area low in the canopy exhibited behaviour consistent with water limitation. Leaf loss from short trees in high light during drought may be associated with strategies to tolerate limited access to deep soil water and stressful leaf environments. Vertically and environmentally structured phenological processes suggest a critical role of canopy structural heterogeneity in seasonal changes in Amazon ecosystem function. © 2019 The Authors.

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is one of the most used techniques in quantifying Se. However, due to some disadvantages (high cost, long analysis time, and being destructive), there is a need for new alternatives to Se quantification. This study aimed at establishing instrumental parameters for Se quantification, using two energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (EDXRF) techniques (benchtop and handheld) in Se-biofortified broccoli seedlings and comparing it with ICP-MS. The results showed that the selection of proper filters for both EDXRF systems was crucial for determining Se and, when compared with ICP-MS, presented similar results for selenium-biofortified broccoli seedling treatments (BS50Se). In addition, the EDXRF techniques presented a Se limit of detection (LOD) at 0.6–0.9 mg kg−1. This study demonstrates that EDXRF systems were successfully applied to concentration measurement of Se in biofortified samples and linked to low cost and shorter analysis time. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption, translocation and metabolism of                              14                             C-aminocyclopyrachlor in young plants of Ipomoea purpurea and Ipomoea triloba. Assessments were performed at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after treatment (HAT) for the study of absorption and translocation. Metabolism was assessed at three time points (3, 24 and 72 HAT). In terms of absorption, was observed a difference between species at the 3 and 48 HAT time points, where I. purpurea had a higher absorption of                              14                             C-aminocyclopyrachlor. No differences were observed between species at any other time points. Of the total absorbed herbicide, 90.9% for I. purpurea and 91.8% for I. triloba were detected on the treated leaf. I. purpurea presented higher translocation to the leaf above the treated leaf, while I. triloba showed higher translocation to the lower leaves and roots. No increase in absorption of                              14                             C-aminocyclopyrachlor was observed above 24 HAT for I. purpurea and above 6 HAT for I. triloba, and translocation was low (<1%) for both species in all plant parts. This suggests that post-emergence application of aminocyclopyrachlor cannot be effective for the control of I. purpurea and I. triloba and alternative approaches are required. Nevertheless, no                              14                             C-aminocyclopyrachlor metabolites were observed in the studied plants, which indicated sensitivity in I. purpurea and I. triloba to the herbicide.                          © 2018 European Weed Research Society	Article	Scopus

The erectoid leaf phenotype was inherited as a semi-dominant trait and it co-segregated with the u allele of gene SlGLK2 (Solyc10g008160). This genomic location coincides with a previously described semi-dominant mutation named as Erectoid leaf (Erl). The genomes of ‘LT05’, ‘TO-937’, and three other unrelated accessions (with the wild-type Erl+ allele) were resequenced with the aim of identifying candidate genes. Comparative genomic analyses, including the reference genome ‘Heinz 1706’ (Erl+ allele), identified an Erectoid leaf-specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene Solyc10g009320. This SNP caused a change of a glutamine codon (present in all the wild-type genomes) to a TAA (= ochre stop-codon) in the Erl allele, resulting in a smaller version of the predicted mutant protein (221 vs. 279 amino acids). Solyc10g009320, previously annotated as an ‘unknown protein’, was identified as a TILLER ANGLE CONTROL1-like gene. Linkage between the Erl and Solyc10g009320 was confirmed via Sanger sequencing of the PCR amplicons of the two variant alleles. No recombinants were detected in 265 F2 individuals. Contrasting S7 near-isogenic lines were also homozygous for each of the alternate alleles, reinforcing Solyc10g009320 as a strong Erl candidate gene and opening the possibility for fine-tuning manipulation of tomato architecture in breeding programs. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

Thus, our aim in this study was to select biochemical, morpho-physiological, nutritional, and productive responses associated to Cd accumulation in the roots, stems and sheaths, and leaf blades of Panicum maximum cv. Massai (Massai grass), using the random forests analysis. Massai grass was exposed to combinations of three sulfur (S) concentrations (0.1, 1.9, and 3.7 mmol L−1) and two Cd concentrations (0.0 and 0.1 mmol L−1) in nutrient solutions. The dry biomass production of Massai grass exposed to Cd decreased by around 50% in relation to control. However, there were no visual symptoms of Cd toxicity in the shoot of this plant, even with Cd concentrations in their shoot exceeding 100 mg kg−1 DW. The lowest dry biomass production of the plants exposed to Cd combined with the absence of visual symptoms of Cd toxicity indicates us that Massai grass is a bioindicator plant that can greatly cope with the Cd-induced stress, but in a little bit different way from other plants. Antioxidant enzymes apparently are not essential for Massai grass cope with Cd-induced stress, differently of other mechanisms (e.g., higher synthesis of thiol compounds and amino acids involved on reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and Cd chelation). Probably, the plant responses that most explained Cd accumulation in Massai grass can be used to identify grasses with high capacity to accumulate Cd in phytoremediation programs with this group of plants. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

In contrast, ruzigrass (Urochloa ruziziensis) has been reported to decrease the yield and N accumulation of the subsequent crop and hence can affect N use efficiency and the fate of applied N. We investigated the effects of Guinea grass (M. maximum), palisade grass (U. brizantha), and ruzigrass on succeeding crop yield, N accumulation, and the fate of 15N–labeled fertilizer applied to maize (Zea mays L.) in a 2–year field experiment in Brazil. Maize was fertilized with 140 kg ha–1 N as (15NH4)2SO4 or not fertilized, and recovery of residual 15N was quantified in the second season. Net nitrification rates through an incubation study had no differences among grasses. Nitrogen application increased maize yield and N accumulation in both seasons, whereas maize yield decreased by 9.5% following ruzigrass compared with the other forages. The grasses had no effect on 15N recovery by maize or in the system. On average, the recovery of 15N in maize and soil was 34% and 46% in the first growing season and 2.9% and 20% in the second season, respectively. Our results indicated that tropical perennial grasses had no differential effects on nitrification rates and the fate of 15N–labeled fertilizer in the plant–litter–soil system in the season of application nor in the subsequent crop (residual effect). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Our study used a palynotaxonomic approach to analyse 13 species of Tephrosia (T. adunca, T. candida, T. cinerea, T. egregia, T. marginata, T. nitens, T. noctiflora, T. purpurea subsp. purpurea, T. domingensis, T. rufescens, T. sessiliflora, T. sinapou, T. vogelii), either native or cultivated in Brazil. Pollen was studied using light microscopy as well as scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. Pollen grains are isopolar, small to large size, oblate to prolate, 3-colporate, mostly operculate with an ornamented colporus membrane. Sexine show a nanoreticulate to reticulate, microreticulate-perforate, rugulate-perforate, rugulate, psilate or psilate-perforate ornamentation; the sexine is thicker than the nexine. Exine consists of a compact tectum that varies from eutectate, tectate perforate to semitectate; the infratectum is collumelar or granular; the foot layer is discontinuous and endexine continuous. An unprecedented characterisation of the operculum, colporus membrane and granular structure of the infractectum in Tephrosia is described for the first time. The pollen morphology in Tephrosia is eurypalynous based mainly on the exine sculpturing that is the most variable morphological feature and also on the details of the aperture, which is important for infrageneric delimitation, and warrants attention in future phylogenetic analysis combining molecular and morphological data. © 2019, © 2019 Collegium Palynologicum Scandinavicum.

They subsidize the advances of agriculture in the 21st century; however, so far, beneficial as well as detrimental results have been reported. In this context, analytical tools for monitoring macronutrients and micronutrients in plants exposed to NPs, with adequate performance and low cost, are required. This work assesses the use of energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometry for elemental content evaluation in NP-containing agricultural samples. For Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) seedlings treated with ZnO NP, CuO NP, and Fe3O4 NP, the limits of detection (LODs) were 0.4 mg kg−1 for Zn and Cu and 0.6 mg kg−1 for Fe after dry-ashing digestion, thus being suitable for NP oxide monitoring in seed priming. For submicron suspension fertilizers, Mn, Cu, and Zn were quantified as thin films after sample dilution. The LODs for Mn, Cu, and Zn were 0.09, 0.1, and 0.08 mg L−1, respectively. Finally, for P. vulgaris plants exposed to 300-nm ZnO NP, we monitored P, S, K, Ca, and Zn directly in powdered leaves, whose LODs ranged from 1.3 to 27 mg kg−1. No critical spectral interference was observed, and notable repeatability and suitable trueness were found in the cases of studies. EDXRF revealed itself a simple, fast, and reliable alternative to evaluate the elemental content in suspensions or the uptake of NP by plants. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	Review	Scopus

Merr.] grain yield is closely associated with the level of optimal nitrogen (N) supply, especially during the reproductive stages. Foliar fertilization with low rates of N have been considered as a strategy for furnishing additional N and enhancing grain yields. Field studies using                              15                             N tracer were conducted over two growing seasons to investigate the impact of foliar N fertilization on grain yield, plant N content, the amount of N derived from fertilizer (NDFF) and N recovery efficiency (NRE). Four foliar N rates (0, 1300, 2600 and 3900 g ha-1) were supplied by two equal split applications at the R1 and R3 stages. Foliar N fertilization of soybean canopies did not affect grain yield, grain N content, shoot N content nor plant N content. Total NDFF was increased from 0.7 to 2.0 kg ha-1 across the N rates. Nonetheless, NRE was unaffected by foliar N fertilization, which averaged 53 %. Soybean plants allocated the same amount of N fertilizer to both grains and shoots. No significant effects of low rate foliar N fertilization were registered on soybean grain yield nor plant N content, despite considerable N fertilizer recovery by plant organs.                          © 2019, Scientia Agricola.

However, there is little information available on the interaction of natural biochar with the herbicides applied directly into the soil. To address this knowledge gap, the influence of natural biochar on the sorption–desorption and mobility of diclosulam and pendimethalin herbicides in an agricultural soil was evaluated. The biochar was extracted from the profile of an Oxisol and post-dates the Holocene. The Ultisol-Typic Hapludalf used in this study was amended with natural biochar at rates of 0 (control), 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0% (m m                             −1                             ). The                              14                             C-diclosulam and                              14                             C-pendimethalin showed specific activities of 0.002587 and 5.55 MBq mg                             −1                             , respectively. The sorption–desorption process was assessed by batch–equilibrium experiments. Liquid scintillation counting and soil thin-layer chromatography were used to determine herbicides adsorption and mobility. Application of natural biochar slightly increased the linear sorption coefficient (K                             d                             ) of each herbicide (from 0.22 to 0.50 L kg                             −1                              for diclosulam, and from 25.55 and 37.81 L kg                             −1                              for pendimethalin) in the soil, and the corresponding sorption percentages were 18.53–34.14% and 96.22–97.42%, respectively. However, the soil amendment did not alter the mobility of either herbicide, with retention factor (R                             f                             ) values of ~0.99 and 0.20 for diclosulam and pendimethalin, respectively, regardless of the natural biochar amount. Therefore, the presence of biochar in soil may not interfere with the bioavailability of diclosulam and pendimethalin in weed control under field conditions.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Autotrophic carbon conservation in mangroves remains controversial. In this sense, autotrophic nutrient assimilation by crabs can highlight their ecosystem function. This study aims to identify the relationship between quality sources and food partitioning in two leaf-eating crabs, Ucides cordatus and Goniopsis cruentata. Quantification of the litterfall biomass, analysis of the soil, the C/N ratio and stable isotopes (δ                             13                             C and δ                             15                             N) were used to evaluate food sources and crab tissues in two mangrove forests. The litterfall and soil C contents and C/N ratios of the Pacoti River (PR) were higher than those of the Jaguaribe River. The higher C/N ratios of the litterfall of the PR led to higher nitrogen ingestion from complementary food sources (soil and omnivorous invertebrates). The nutritional requirements and food partitioning behavior of both species emphasize the ecosystem functions of leaf-eating crabs concerning the assimilation and conservation of autotrophic carbon and nitrogen in mangroves.                          © 2018 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

A control treatment (without N) was also included. N treatments were applied at V4 (vegetative leaf stage 4) on soil surface. HS was not efficient on AV reduction, NBPT had the greatest reduction in AV, and B had higher efficiency on AV reduction than Cu. At V8 (vegetative leaf stage 8), NBPT had the greatest NUE followed by B. At VT (tassel fully emerged), NUE from urea treated with NBPT reduced when increased levels of HS, and NBPT had the greatest NRE. UI in association with HS treated-urea does not reduce AV and it does not improve NUE by maize in vegetative stages.                          © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

A simple way to assess the relationship between temperature and plant physiology is through the characterization of leaf traits. The main aim of this study was to evaluate, through foliar parameters, the responses of plants to inherent seasonality. A 0.09 ha plot was installed near the flux tower and albedo sensors at Montane Ombrophilous Dense Forest (MODF)-Santa Virgínia Nucleus. At the peak of the dry and wet seasons, the electron transport rate (ETR) and photosynthetic pigments were measured. The results indicated that in MODF, cold and light availability are the main factors that could be influencing the physiology of species, demonstrated by high ETR in the wet season (197.4 μmol e-m-2s-1) compared to the dry season (87.4 μmol e-m-2s-1). Photosynthetic pigments varied between seasons, we observed higher chlorophyll b content (p<0.05), and lower content of carotenoids and xanthophylls (p<0.01) and Chl a/b (p<0.01) in the dry season. The low temperatures and irradiance influenced metabolic activity. © 2019, Federal University of Lavras. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

If several bands of a given diatomic molecule are simultaneously measured, they may be used in multi-energy calibration (MEC), a method based on the use of several wavelengths of the same absorbing/emitting entity to improve the accuracy in analytical atomic spectrometry. In this work, MEC is used for the first time as a calibration method for HR-CS MAS using flame (F) and graphite furnace (GF) atomizers. Methods were developed and applied for the determination of N, P and S in fertilizers by HR-CS F MAS and Cl in milk by HR-CS GF MAS. Chlorine, N, P and S were measured via CaCl (10 band heads), NO (13 band heads), PO (13 band heads) and CS (14 band heads), respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed between Cl, N, P and S concentrations determined by MEC and by the conventional external standard calibration (paired t-test at a 95% confidence level, n = 3). Recoveries were in the 97-109% (Cl), 97-103% (P), 99-109% (S) and 98-99% (N) intervals, and the relative standard deviations (n = 12) for Cl, N, P, and S were typically 6%, 3%, 2% and 2%, respectively. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

To generate new plant variants which would perform satisfactorily in the field and produce seeds of better composition, gamma rays can be used. Therefore, soybean seeds from line VX04-6828 were irradiated in a 60Co source (gamma rays) in doses: 0 (control); 50; 150 and 250 Gy, and were seeded to produce the M1 generation. Potential plants of each row were identified and evaluated for their agronomic performance. The seeds of the selected plants were sown, producing the plants of M2 generation and again selected and evaluated, including the chemical composition of their seeds. It was concluded that the use of gamma radiation increases the variability in soybean, with consequent increase in the probabilities of identification of new mutants, useful to breeding programs that aim at better agronomic performance and gains in the composition of the seeds. Better results are observed when 50 to 150 Gy is applied on soybean dry seeds. © 2017 United Arab Emirates University.	Article	Scopus

Results indicated that most of the shoyu in Brazil contained <20% soy, and the dominant cereal was maize due to its cheaper price. However, the authors have greatly over interpreted their data set and thus the subsequent conclusions drawn now require critical comment and discussion. The sample size was not enough to support any conclusion about them. In addition, the stewing process in the production of shoyu could significantly affect the degree of the isotopic fractionation, resulting in the unreliable δ                             13                             C and δ                             15                             N values of shoyu. Therefore, more samples should be determined for a more reliable method validation and several measures should be taken to eliminate or reduce the isotopic fractionation caused by external processing conditions before determination.                          © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In order to better understand this effect, we used metagenomics to investigate microbial patterns and functions in bulk soil and rhizosphere of soybean, in a long-term forest-to-agriculture conversion. Long-term forest-to-agriculture led to microbial homogenization and loss of diversity in both bulk soil and rhizosphere, mainly driven by decreasing aluminum concentration and increased cations saturation in soil, due to liming and fertilization in long-term no-till cropping. Data revealed that long-term no-till cropping culminated in a decrease in Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria abundances. However, α- and β-Proteobacteria abundances were higher in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil, regardless of the time after forest-to-agriculture conversion. Changes in functional potential occurred predominantly in bulk soil, with decreases in functions related to potassium metabolism and virulence, disease and defense, while functions related to nucleic acids metabolism increased. Functions in the soybean rhizosphere remained stable, except for those related to potassium metabolism, which decreased after 20-year no-till cropping. Together, our results show that the soybean root system selects microbial taxa via trade-offs, to maintain functional resilience in the rhizosphere microbiome over time. © FEMS 2019.

Blood catalase activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity were higher in SB than CS (P < 0.05), suggesting that cottonseed increased oxidative stress in ewes. Cottonseed consumption increased IgG concentration, lysozyme activity and total protein concentration in the colostrum and decreased iron stock, suggesting a positive effect of this nutrient on the immune quality, antibacterial activity and antioxidant potential of colostrum. © 2019	Article	Scopus

These food compounds are capable of prevent and/or improve metabolic disorders associated to chronic diseases. To provide a good source of bioactive compounds and a better destination for RB, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the antioxidant potential of functional cookies made with this by-product. Five different formulations containing 25, 50, 75 and 100% of RB were studied and, in the control formulation, RB was substituted by polished rice flour. Cookies were analyzed up to 30 days of storage, regarding the levels of fibers, γ-oryzanol and lutein. The antioxidant capacity was determined through DPPH                             ●                              and FRAP assays. The shelf life was determined through microbiological analyses and the acceptance was evaluated by means of hedonic scale acceptance test and purchase intention test. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) among the formulations regarding the fibers content, γ-oryzanol, lutein and antioxidant capacity, which values increased according to the RB content in the composition. Sensory analysis showed a higher acceptance of the formulations with RB the control cookies, with preference for the cookie containing 75% of RB. Cookies containing RB can be produced at low cost, becoming accessible to consumers, and provide an effective alternative to improve the population nutrition and the utilization of this by-product.                          © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Importance of model-based development is increasing in industrial world. Model-based development is performed according to a development process called the ""V-type development process (V-process)."" However, several professional engineers involved in automobile development have insufficient experience in conducting model-based development. In this study, the authors propose a program that allows these professional engineers to learn the V-process using a motor control system via a hands-on approach. The program is implemented to target 159 professional engineers belonging to Mazda Motor Corporation. From the questionnaire surveys taken by the learners, it is revealed that the V-process exercises considerably contribute to the self-efficacy of the learners for operational performance using model-based development. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

After the formation of soluble barium sulfate in alcoholic medium, the remaining barium forms a product with dimethylsulfonazo III (DMS), the absorbance of which was monitored at 655 nm directly in the reaction chamber. The proposed procedure does not require any sample treatment such as dilution. Under the optimized conditions, the technique offers the advantages of low waste generation (<5 mL), sampling throughput of 35 h−1, linear response from 0.1–1.5 mg L−1 sulfate, and a limit of detection (95%) and coefficient of variation (n = 6) of 48 μg L−1 and 1%, respectively. The accuracy was assessed by comparison of results with those obtained by ion-chromatography; no significant difference was observed at the 95% confidence level. © 2018	Article	Scopus

Previous studies report plasticity for the venom phenotype. However, these observations are not conclusive, as the results were based on pooled venoms, which present high individual variability. Here we tested the hypothesis of plasticity by influence of confinement and single diet type in the venom composition of 13 adult specimens of Bothrops atrox snakes, maintained under captivity for more than three years. Individual variability in venom composition was observed in samples extracted just after the capture of the snakes. However, composition was conserved in venoms periodically extracted from nine specimens, which presented low variability restricted to the less abundant components. In a second group, composed of four snakes, drastic changes were observed in the venom samples extracted at different periods, mostly related to snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), the core function toxins of B. atrox venom, which occurred approximately between 400 and 500 days in captivity. These data show plasticity in the venom phenotype during the lifetime of adult snakes maintained under captive conditions. Causes or functional consequences involved in the phenotype modification require further investigations. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	Article	Scopus

The low efficiency of gas diffusion may however limit the sensitivity of flow-based procedures involving gas-liquid separation. This paper deals with the evaluation of potentialities and limitations of a flow analyzer exploiting a new strategy for gas-liquid separation. The manifold comprised a lab-made syringe pump connected to a separation chamber and solenoid valves for solution management. Gas diffusion without barriers for phase separation was implemented inside the chamber under an air flux, followed by the transference of headspace towards an acceptor/derivatization solution inside the syringe. The innovation was exploited for the determination of dissolved inorganic carbon in natural waters. Sample and an acidic solution were aspirated to the chamber and the generated CO2 was directed towards a bromothymol blue solution, whose color change was monitored by spectrophotometry. A linear response range was attained within 0.5 and 5.0 mg L−1, with limit of detection of 0.25 mg L−1, variation coefficient < 5% (n = 10), and sampling rate of 12 h−1. An 11.5-fold increase in sensitivity was attained with the proposed procedure in relation to the analogous membrane-based procedure. Results for the analysis of river waters agreed with those attained by the reference procedure at the 95% confidence level. © 2018	Article	Scopus

To test the hypothesis of dietary resource partitioning between batoids within a communal nursery, we investigated two cownose ray species, Rhinoptera bonasus and R. brasiliensis, which occur in heterospecific groups, a strategy predicted to increase survival and foraging success. Using two biochemical tracers, fatty acids (FA) and stable isotopes (δ                             15                             N and δ                             13                             C), the combined effects of maternal investment and the formation of heterospecific groups implying competition for, or partitioning of available food resources were investigated. Through univariate and multivariate analyses of biochemical tracers in several tissues (fin clip, muscle, liver, red blood cells; RBC) and plasma, our results revealed significant interspecific differences in tracers between the two species. Total FAs (∑saturated FA, ∑monounsaturated FA and ∑polyunsaturated FA) and trophic biomarkers (i.e., docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, oleic acid and δ                             15                             N) were the principle tracers responsible for the differences detected. These data revealed that R. brasiliensis was less enriched in physiologically important essential FAs than R. bonasus. Our findings suggest that these congeneric species differ in maternal investment strategy and moderately partition food resources over relatively fine spatial scales within a single nursery habitat to limit competition. These results provide further knowledge on the foraging strategies adopted by batoids in communal nursery areas, information that is required for improving spatial conservation and management planning.                          © 2019 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles	Article	Scopus

The antifungal activity of the essential oils (EOs) of Eucalyptus staigeriana, Lippia sidoides and Pimenta pseudocaryophyllus was tested in vitro against plant pathogen Rhizopus stolonifer. The chemical composition of the EO with the highest activity and its effects on pathogen morphology were verified. The in vivo antifungal activity of this EO associated with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) coating, in preventive and curative applications, was also evaluated. L. sidoides EO presented the highest in vitro antifungal activity. The analysis of the chemical composition of this EO showed a prevalence of the compound thymol and the scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that L. sidoides EO was able to cause damage to the cell wall and the intracellular components of the pathogen.

However, here we present a 57 cm core, collected from a waterlogged sandy soil in the lowland Atlantic Forest of SE Brazil, which shows good stratigraphy and good preservation of pollen and spores since ~ 7000 cal. BP, both in organic and in mineral horizons. By the other hand, the decomposition of the organic matter and its translocation along the soil profile led to changes of C and N results (TOC, TN, C/N, δ                             13                             C and δ                             15                             N). Mid-Holocene paleoclimate inferences from this study are in accordance with climate fluctuations presented in previous studies for Central, Southeastern and Southern Brazil, when a change to more humid climate occurred at ~ 7000 cal BP. The process responsible for the presence of biological proxies along this sandy soil profile involves the continuous deposition of these proxies together with litter and sand, and the subsequent decomposition of the litter. Ultimately, this process led to the vertical accretion of the sand with the more resistant organic structures preserved in stratigraphic sequence. The preservation of pollen and spores along the profile is probably caused by low pH and redoximorphic conditions due to water saturation. This study suggests the potential for retrieving useful paleoecological information from mineral and organic horizons of tropical waterlogged sandy soils, which is especially useful for those regions where traditional pollen archives (lakes and peat bogs) are absent.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Anethole and carvone (10% each), encapsulated with 80% of a solid matrix, referred to as EO (encapsulated oils), were tested in vivo in 2 experiments. In Experiment 1: Lambs were artificially infected with multidrug resistant Haemonchus contortus, or left uninfected, and treated (or not) with 50 mg/kg bw (body weight) of EO in a controlled environment. Thirty-two male lambs were kept in individual cages for a period of 45 days, after which animals were evaluated for parasitological, hematological, toxicological, and nutritional parameters. After 45 days of treatment, EO at 50 mg/kg bw provided a significant (P ≤ 0.05) reduction in fecal egg count (FEC). Although FEC was reduced, animals from both treatments had similar counts of total adult worms. The low FEC was caused probably by a significant reduction (P ≤ 0.05) in both male worm size and female fecundity. Dry matter intake of uninfected controls was significantly (P ≤ 0.05) reduced, although no toxicity was observed in treated animals. Thus, in Experiment 2, conducted for five months we used an EO dose of 20 mg/kg bw. Thirty-four weaned lambs, free of parasites, were divided in two groups and kept in collective pens. One group received EO at 20 mg/kg bw mixed with concentrate for 5 months and the other was kept as a control group (CTL). Parasitological and hematological parameters as well as body weight were evaluated. In the first 2.5 months, CTL and EO groups were confined, and both presented similar clinical parameters. Then, animals were allotted to graze on contaminated pastures to acquire natural infection for the next 2.5 months. The infection was patent after 25 days and both groups had similar decreases in weight gain, increases in FEC, and decreases in blood parameters. Coprocultures from CTL and EO groups established that parasite population was 90% Haemonchus sp. We concluded that the technology of encapsulation is safe and practical to deliver to lambs at the farm level and anethole and carvone at 50 mg/kg bw caused a significant decrease in FEC and, consequently, in pasture contamination by free living stages of H. contortus. However, EO at 20 mg/kg bw was not effective to prevent or treat sheep naturally-infected with gastrointestinal nematodes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.	Article	Scopus

The uredospores of A. psidii infect Eucalyptus by engaging in close contact with the host surface and interacting with the leaf cuticle that provides important chemical and physical signals to trigger the infection process. In this study, the cuticular waxes of Eucalyptus spp. were analyzed to determine their composition or structure and correlation with susceptibility/resistance to A. psidii. Twenty-one Eucalyptus spp. in the field were classified as resistant or susceptible. The resistance/susceptibility level of six Eucalyptus spp. were validated in controlled conditions using qPCR, revealing that the pathogen can germinate on the eucalyptus surface of some species without multiplying in the host. CG-TOF-MS analysis detected 26 compounds in the Eucalyptus spp. cuticle and led to the discovery of the role of hexadecanoic acid in the susceptibility of Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus phaeotricha to A. psidii. We characterized the epicuticular wax morphology of the six previously selected Eucalyptus spp. using scanning electron microscopy and observed different behavior in A. psidii germination during host infection. It was found a correlation of epicuticular morphology on the resistance to A. psidii. However, in this study, we provide the first report of considerable interspecific variation in Eucalyptus spp. on the susceptibility to A. psidii and its correlation with cuticular waxes chemical compounds that seem to play a synergistic role as a preformed defense mechanism. © 2019 Santos, Lopes, Bini, Tschoeke, Verssani, Figueredo, Cataldi, Marques, Silva, Labate and Quecine.

The samples were collected in dry and rainy periods on 2010 and 2011, and submitted the grain size analyses, total organic matter and calcium carbonate quantifications, and carbon and nitrogen percentages and isotopic compositions. The sedimentological results varied for estuary from very fine silt to coarse silt with coarse silt predominance and for inner continental shelf from coarse silt to coarse sand with medium sand predominance. The organic matter and carbonate contents varied from 1.5 to 21.7% and 1.7 to 87.3%, respectively. The organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratios and its isotopic ratios varied from 0.11 to 8.87%, 0.01 to 1.02%, 6.01 to 18.81,-25.90 to-20.85‰PDB and-1.14 to 7.66‰Air, respectively. The high rainfall indexes incremented the river flux increasing the hydrodynamic energy, consequently, intensified the erosion processes of margins and the transport of fine sediments and TOM to the continental shelf. During the dry periods the estuary showed a retention behavior of fine sediments and organic matter occasioned by decrease of hydrodynamic energy in estuarine system. The isotopic results demonstrated that the Capibaribe estuary showed sources different of TOM. The estuary registered environmental impact, from domestic wastes released in system, characterizing evidence of anthropogenic pollution (δ15N <2‰Ar). © 2019, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

However, SS may have high concentrations of potentially toxic elements (PTE), representing a potential risk for soil and the whole ecosystem. This paper was aimed to assess the toxicity of PTE in unfertile tropical soils amended with SS in a commercial Eucalyptus plantation, with an integrated multiple approaches combining: i) the use of a battery of bioassays (Daphnia magna, Pseudokcrichirella subcapitata, Lactuca sativa, and Allium cepa); and ii) the evaluation of some PTE (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and their availability into the pedoenvironment. Differences in total and available PTE between SS doses and time of treatments were evaluated using ANOVA; correlations between PTE and bioassays by a sparse partial robust M-regression (SPRM), while multiple correlations among parameters were performed by principal factor analysis (PFA). Results show that PTE contents in soils tended to increase with SS application doses. However this cannot be assumed as a general rule since in all the investigated treatments the PTE concentrations were consistently below both soil natural background concentrations and quality reference values. Bioassays showed a generalized low eco- and genotoxicity of SS with an increase in toxicity at increasing SS doses but with a clear decreasing trend as time went by. A. cepa was the most sensitive bioassay followed by P. subcapitata > D. magna > L. sativa. Overall, the results indicate that in realistic open field conditions SS risk may be lower than expected due to dynamic decrease in PTE toxicity with time after application. This study has an important implication that open-field trials should be strongly encouraged for evaluating environmental risk of SS application in forestry. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

A commonly observed response to land-use change is a negative impact on biodiversity of plant and animal species. However, its effect on the soil microbial community and ecosystem functioning is still poorly understood. Here, we used a DNA metagenomic sequencing approach to investigate the impact of land-use change on soil microbial community composition and its potential functions in three land-use systems (primary forest, pasture and secondary forest) in the Amazon region. In general, the microbial community structure was influenced by changes in soil physicochemical properties. Aluminum and water-holding capacity significantly correlated to overall community structure and most of microbial phyla. Taxonomic changes were followed by potential functional changes in the soil microbial community, with pasture presenting the most distinct profile in comparison with other sites. Although taxonomic structure was very distinct among sites, we observed a recovery of the potential functions in secondary forest after pasture abandonment. Our findings elucidate a significant shift in belowground microbial taxonomic and potential functional diversity following natural forest re-establishment and have implications for ecological restoration programs in tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems. © FEMS 2018.

Here, we compared a granular PL-derived OMF to triple superphosphate (TSP) in two contrasting tropical soils (Oxisol and Entisol) by using isotope dilution with 32P. Our study aimed to gain insight into soil P fractionation, and P availability to maize plants achieved by P fertilization (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg kg−1 of soil), in order to investigate the agronomic effectiveness of OMF. Despite μ-XRF maps revealing that the mixture of PL and TSP as OMF resulted in P hot spots disseminated in a low-concentration background, whereas for the TSP treatment higher P concentration was uniformly distributed in the granules, there was no difference in maize yield and fertilizer P recovery (%R) between P sources in both soils. In the Oxisol, there was no difference between fertilizers in any of the soil P pools, but larger readily phytoavailable P and smaller moderately labile P fractions were obtained with OMF. In the Entisol, the labile P pool was larger with TSP. Nevertheless, acid and alkaline phosphatase activity and microbial biomass were affected by P rate and P source. The results show that OMF is an effective substitute for conventional phosphate fertilizers, since OMF promotes P recovery, plant P uptake and biomass yields compared to those obtained with TSP. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we propose the use of Nauphoeta cinerea cockroaches as an alternative biological model for the biomonitoring of the activity of anatoxin-a(s) in aquatic systems. In order to validate our proposed model, we compared the effects of a cyanobacterial extract containing anatoxin-a(s) (CECA) with those of the organophosphate trichlorfon (Tn) on biochemical and physiological parameters of the nervous system of Nauphoeta cinerea cockroaches. In brain homogenates from cockroaches, CECA (5 and 50 μg/g) inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity by 53 ± 2% and 51 ± 7%, respectively, while Tn (5 and 50 μg/g) inhibited AChE activity by 35 ± 4% and 80 ± 9%, respectively (p < 0.05; n = 6). Moreover, CECA at concentrations of 5, 25, and 50 µg/g decreased the locomotor activity of the cockroaches, diminishing the distance travelled and increasing the frequency and duration of immobile episodes similarly to Tn (0.3 μg/g) (p < 0.05, n = 40, respectively). CECA (5, 25 and 50 μg/g) induced an increase in the leg grooming behavior, but not in the movement of antennae, similarly to the effect of Tn (0.3 μg/g). In addition, both CECA (50 µg/200 μl) and Tn (0.3 µg/200 μl) induced a negative chronotropism in the insect heart (37 ± 1 and 47 ± 8 beats/min in 30 min, respectively) (n = 9, p > 0.05). Finally, CECA (50 µg/g), Tn (0.3 µg/g) and neostigmine (50 µg/g) caused significant neuromuscular failure, as indicated by the monitoring of the in vivo neuromuscular function of the cockroaches, during 100 min (n = 6, p < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, sublethal doses of CECA provoked entomotoxicity. The Tn-like effects of CECA on Nauphoeta cinerea cockroaches encompass both the central and peripheral nervous systems in our insect model. The inhibitory activity of CECA on AChE boosts a cascade of signaling events involving octopaminergic/dopaminergic neurotransmission. Therefore, this study indicates that this insect model could potentially be used as a powerful, practical, and inexpensive tool to understand the impacts of eutrophication and for orientating decontamination processes. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

New configurations for sample preparation exploiting monoliths as extraction materials, as well as the recent approaches for the synthesis and the functionalization of inorganic, organic, and hybrid organic-inorganic monolithic materials are also discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In heterobaric leaves, bundle sheath extensions (BSEs) increase photosynthetic performance (light-saturated rates of photosynthesis, A                             max                             ) and water transport capacity (leaf hydraulic conductance, K                             leaf                             ). However, it is not clear how BSEs affect these and other leaf developmental and physiological parameters in response to environmental conditions. The obscuravenosa (obv) mutation, found in many commercial tomato varieties, leads to absence of BSEs. We examined structural and physiological traits of tomato heterobaric and homobaric (obv) near-isogenic lines grown at two different irradiance levels. K                             leaf                             , minor vein density, and stomatal pore area index decreased with shading in heterobaric but not in homobaric leaves, which show similarly lower values in both conditions. Homobaric plants, on the other hand, showed increased A                             max                             , leaf intercellular air spaces, and mesophyll surface area exposed to intercellular airspace (S                             mes                             ) in comparison with heterobaric plants when both were grown in the shade. BSEs further affected carbon isotope discrimination, a proxy for long-term water-use efficiency. BSEs confer plasticity in traits related to leaf structure and function in response to irradiance levels and might act as a hub integrating leaf structure, photosynthetic function, and water supply and demand.                          © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	Article	Scopus

However, research is needed to assess the efficiency of these products in mitigating ammonia emission. The aim of this study was to compare volatilization losses of ammonia following application of UR treated with B and Cu (B-Cu-UR), UR treated with dicyandiamide (DCD) and N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) (DCD-NBPT-UR), UR treated with humic substances (HS-UR), UR treated with NBPT (NBPT-UR), polymer S-coated UR (PSCUR), S-coated UR (SCUR), and untreated and uncoated UR (UR). Fertilizers (at a rate of 2355 mg N kg−1) were applied over the soil surface, and volatilized ammonia was quantified for 60 d under controlled conditions using a static closed chamber. Use of DCD-NBPT-UR increased ammonia emissions in comparison to UR by blocking nitrification and keeping the soil pH high, the latter resulting from UR hydrolysis. Urease complexation by the inhibitor and gradual N release resulted in low losses of ammonia by NBPT-UR and PSCUR, respectively. Compared to UR, B[sbnd]Cu-UR delayed and slightly decreased ammonia volatilization. HS-UR, SCUR, and UR fertilizers had similar ammonia losses. Humic substances most likely did not act on urea-N complexation or even on decreasing urease activity, whereas immediate release of the nutrient by SCUR was noted. NBPT-UR and PSCUR could substitute for UR, aiming to mitigate ammonia volatilization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Over the past few years, novel theoretical concepts and analytical methods have emerged as powerful tools to understand important aspects of plant architecture. Plant architecture depends on the relative arrangement of three types of organs: leaves, shoots, and flowers. During plant development, the architecture is modulated by the balance of two homologous proteins: FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1). The FT/TFL1 balance defines the plant growth habit as indeterminate or determinate by modulating the pattern of formation of vegetative and reproductive structures in the apical and axillary meristems. Here, we present a summarized review of plant architecture and primarily focus on the FT/TFL1 balance and its effect on plant form and development. We also propose passion fruit as a suitable model plant to study the effect of FT/TFL1 genes on plant architecture. © 2019 Moraes, Dornelas and Martinelli.	Article	Scopus

The completion of the Capsicum annuum genome has sparked new interest into the development of biotechnological applications involving the manipulation of pungency levels. Pungent dishes are already part of the traditional cuisine in many countries, and numerous health benefits and industrial applications are associated to capsaicinoids. This raises the question of how to successfully produce more capsaicinoids, whose biosynthesis is strongly influenced by genotype–environment interactions in fruits of Capsicum. In this Opinion article we propose that activating the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway in a more amenable species such as tomato could be the next step in the fascinating story of pungent crops. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd	Review	Scopus

A low-power UV radiation source (germicidal lamp) was placed close to a flow-batch chamber and a 3D-built support for the reaction chamber was used to couple fiber optic cables in the orthogonal direction with the UV-lamp beam, allowing the monitoring of nanoparticle formation in real-time using a spectrophotometer. The nanoparticles were characterized via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and UV–vis spectroscopy. Most of the particles exhibited a spherical shape with an average diameter of 18 nm. The absorbance maximum was observed at 440 nm and was used for chloride determination in fuel ethanol. Under the optimized working conditions, the system exhibited a linear response from 0.05 to 0.8 mg L−1 chloride, with a limit of detection (95%) and coefficient of variation (n = 8) were estimated to be 12 μg L−1 chloride and 2.2%, respectively. The intra- and inter-day precisions (coefficient of variation) were 2.4% and 2.8%, respectively. This working range (0.05–0.8 mg L−1) for the determination of chloride at low concentrations met the limit required by Brazilian legislation (limit of 1.0 mg kg−1). Analyses of fuel ethanol were performed without sample treatment and the obtained results were compared with those obtained by ion-chromatography. No significant differences were observed between the two methods at the 95% confidence level. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

However, the right percentage of K substitution by Na is not yet known for Eucalyptus seedlings, since a few experiments have only compared treatments receiving K or Na. This study evaluated five levels of Na supply (0, 0.45, 0.90, 1.35 and 1.80 mM) as substitution for K in Eucalyptus seedlings grown in nutrient solution. Plants growth, biomass, K-nutritional status, leaf gas exchange, leaf carbon isotopic composition (δ                             13                             C ‰), leaf water potential (Ψ                             w                             ), leaf area (LA), stomatal density (SD) and water use efficiency (WUE) were measured. The highest total biomass yield was achieved by the Na estimated rate of 0.25 mM, corresponding to a leaf K: Na ratio of 3.41, and having the lowest δ                             13                             C values. Conversely, the highest Na rate (1.8 mM) induced K deficiency symptoms, lower growth, reduced total dry matter yield, leaf gas exchange, LA, SD and a higher δ                             13                             C, which presented a trend to an inverse correlation with CO                             2                              assimilation rate (A), WUE and shoot dry matter. Collectively, our results conclude that substitution of 25% of K by Na (0.45 mM of Na) provided significant gains in nutritional status and positive plant physiological responses by increasing WUE, stomatal diffusion, and by augmenting CO                             2                              uptake efficiency. This nutritional management can therefore be an alternative option to optimize yields and resource use efficiencies in Eucalyptus cultivation.                          © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS	Article	Scopus

Understanding Cd-induced physiological responses in lettuce plants can contribute to the definition of useful strategies to decrease Cd uptake. This study aimed to gain new insights into Cd-induced stress by measuring Cd bioaccumulation, nutrient composition, anatomical and ultrastructural changes, and antioxidative metabolism in three lettuce genotypes characterized as having different degrees of Cd tolerance (Vanda = low, Lidia = medium and Stela = high). Plants were grown hydroponically with Cd concentrations of 0.0 and 0.1 or 0.5 μmol L−1, for 30 days. Cadmium uptake in the lettuce genotypes assayed is controlled by the root/shoot ratio, higher root/shoot ratios allowing greater Cd uptake. The Fe and Ni content increased in shoots of the genotype Lidia, which could be associated with a decrease in oxidative stress in chloroplasts due to superoxide dismutase (SOD) isozyme activity. Cadmium-induced oxidative stress is associated with de-structuring of the phloem and xylem in roots, and starch grain and plastoglobule accumulation in chloroplasts. Lettuce genotypes that presented higher SOD and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity presented better preserved anatomical structures. These results suggest that genotypes with less efficient antioxidant defence in the roots tend to take up more Cd, increasing root-to-shoot Cd translocation. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.	Article	Scopus

It complements major sources of carbohydrates, including cereals, root crop, or plantain, as a source of dietary proteins. It is also a significant source of vitamins and minerals like iron and zinc. To fully play its nutritional role, however, its robustness against stresses needs to be strengthened. Foremost among these is drought, which commonly affects its productivity and seed quality. Previous studies have shown that photosynthate remobilization and partitioning is one of the main mechanisms of drought tolerance and overall productivity in common bean. Results: In this study, we sought to determine the inheritance of pod harvest index (PHI), a measure of the partitioning of pod biomass to seed biomass, relative to that of grain yield. We evaluated a recombinant inbred population of the cross of ICA Bunsi and SXB405, both from the Mesoamerican gene pool, to determine the effects of intermittent and terminal drought stresses on the genetic architecture of photosynthate allocation and remobilization in pods of common bean. The population was grown for two seasons, under well-watered conditions and terminal and intermittent drought stress in one year, and well-watered conditions and terminal drought stress in the second year. There was a significant effect of the water regime and year on all the traits, at both the phenotypic and QTL levels. We found nine QTLs for pod harvest index, including a major (17% of variation explained), stable QTL on linkage group Pv07. We also found eight QTLs for yield, three of which clustered with PHI QTLs, underscoring the importance of photosynthate remobilization in productivity. We also found evidence for substantial epistasis, explaining a considerable part of the variation for yield and PHI. Conclusion: Our results highlight the genetic relationship between PHI and yield and confirm the role of PHI in selection of both additive and epistatic effects controlling drought tolerance. These results are a key component to strengthen the robustness of common bean against drought stresses. © 2019 The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

We determined the toxicity of cyanopeptides identified from two strains of Microcystis (M. panniformis MIRS-04 and M. aeruginosa NPDC-01) in a freshwater tropical fish, Astyanax altiparanae (yellowtail tetra, lambari). Aqueous extracts of both Microcystis strains were prepared in order to simulate realistic fish exposure to these substances in a freshwater environment. Both strains were selected because previous assays evidenced the presence of microcystins (MCs) in MIRS-04 and lack of cyanotoxins in NPDC-01. Identification of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites was performed by LC-HR-QTOF-MS and quantification of the MC-LR was carried out by LC-QqQ-MS/MS. MIRS-04 produces the MCs MC-LR, MC-LY and MC-HilR as well as micropeptins B, 973, 959 and k139. NPCD-01 biosynthetizes microginins FR1, FR2/FR4 and SD-755, but does not produce MCs. Larval fish survival and changes in morphology were assessed for 96 h exposure to aqueous extracts of both strains at environmentally relevant concentrations from 0.1 to 0.5 mg (dry weight)/mL, corresponding to 0.15 to 0.74 µg/mL of MC-LR (considering dried amounts of MIRS-04 for comparison). Fish mortality increased with concentration and time of exposure for both strains of Microcystis. The frequencies of morphological abnormalities increased with concentration in both strains, and included abdominal and pericardial oedema, and spinal curvature. Results demonstrate that toxicity was not solely caused by MCs, other classes of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites contributed to the observed toxicity. © 2019 by the authors.

We proposed and tested a single indicator for drainage estimation, the soil drainability index (SDI) based on the near saturated hydraulic conductivity of each layer. We studied rainfall partitioning for eight soils from Brazil and seven different real and generated weather data under scenarios without crop and with a permanent grass cover with three rooting depths, using the HYDRUS-1D model. The SDI showed a good correlation to simulated drainage of the soils. Moreover, well-trained supervised machine-learning methods, including the linear and stepwise linear models (LM, SWLM), besides ensemble regression with boosting and bagging algorithm (ENS-LB, ENS-B), support vector machines (SVMs), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), predicted monthly drainage from bare soil (BS) and grass covered lands (G) using soil–plant–atmosphere parameters (i.e., SDI, monthly precipitation, and evapotranspiration or transpiration). The RMSE values for testing data in BS and G were low, around 1.2 and 1.5 cm month−1 for all methods. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	Article	Scopus

In the field, the definition of the number and location of sensor installation is still arbitrary. How many sensors and where to install them has been studied using the Time Stable Representative Positions (TSRP) concept introduced by Soulis and Elmaloglou (2016). However, the effect of the period of the soil water content data used for the determination of the TSRP is not usually considered. The main objectives of this work are to analyze how the soil water content data collection period within an irrigation cycle affects the determined optimal sensor positioning based on TSRP; and, to evaluate if the sensors positioning affects the prediction of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) by numerical modeling. Over 60,000 soil water content data were obtained during 36 days from 12 TDR probes installed at different monitoring positions in the root zone of an irrigated banana plant. The optimal position of sensors was determined based on the concept of TSRP, considering soil water content data obtained during the entire and during the second part of the irrigation cycles. The SWAP hydrological model was also used to investigate the effect of sensors positioning in prediction of ETc by numerical modeling. It was verified that the use of soil water content data obtained at the beginning of an irrigation cycle - at times when infiltration occurs and there is a high intensity of redistribution of water in the soil - increases the uncertainties regarding the estimation of temporal stability for purposes of irrigation management. The result of the determination of the optimal positioning for sensors installation varies according to the part of the irrigation cycle from which water content measurements are considered. This variation affects the prediction of ETc by numerical modeling. As values of soil water content obtained at the beginning of the irrigation cycle increase the uncertainty of the statistical indicators and are not of practical interest for irrigation management, it is recommended that in the determination of optimal positioning of sensors, only soil water content values obtained after the infiltration and cessation of high rates of irrigation water redistribution are considered. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To elucidate its biological function, we integrated a ShDJ-overexpression construction into the rice Nipponbare genome via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Two transgenic lines with a single copy gene in T                             0                              were selected and evaluated in both the T                             1                              and T                             4                              generations. Transgenic lines had drastically improved survival rate under water deficit conditions, at rates close to 100%, while WT did not survive. Besides, transgenic lines had improved biomass production and higher tillering under water deficit conditions compared with WT plants. Reduced pectin and hemicellulose contents were observed in transgenic lines compared with wild-type plants under both well-watered and water deficit conditions, whereas cellulose content was unchanged in line #17 and reduced in line #29 under conditions of low water availability. Changes in lignin content under water deficit were only observed in line #17. However, improvements in saccharification were found in both transgenic lines along with changes in the expression of OsNTS1/2 and OsMYB58/63 secondary cell wall biosynthesis genes. ShDJ-overexpression up-regulated the expression of the OsbZIP23, OsGRAS23, OsP5CS, and OsLea3 genes in rice stems under well-watered conditions. Taken together, our data suggest that ShDJ has the potential for improving drought tolerance, plant biomass accumulation, and saccharification efficiency.                          © 2019 Andrade, Peixoto-Junior, Ribeiro, Nóbile, Brito, Marchiori, Carlin, Martins, Goldman, Llerena, Fregonesi, Perecin, Nebó, Figueira, Benatti, Silva, Mazzafera and Crest.

Artificial diets containing naturally 13C-labelled sugar can isotopically mark the adults of some tephritids, but when sexually mature flies are released in the field, their food source usually changes from a C4 to a C3 plant. Consequently, the isotopic composition of flies can change toward the isotopic signatures associated with the new diet. For isotope labelling to be more meaningful in a pest management program that integrates the sterile insect technique, it is important to know the persistence of the carbon isotope marker in field-release sterile adults. Therefore, this study was intended to assess the degree of isotopic differentiation between wild samples of Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) and flies reared on different artificial diets, and to estimate the turnover of carbon in flies after shifts to different adult diets. The whole bodies of flies reflected the overall isotopic composition of their larval diets immediately after emergence. When the adult diet was switched, the δ13C signatures of flies changed rapidly for 6 to 8 d, then reached an isotopic equilibrium with the final diet. Depletions up to -5.6 (parts per thousand) were observed in the signatures of flies switched from a C4 to a C3-based diet. However, appropriate feeding on diets with C4 sources ensured that the isotopic composition of larval diets was fixed in body structures of adult A. fraterculus, maintaining measurable 13C signals distinct from wild flies for 15 d after diet switching. No differences were found between males and females when they fed on different pre-release diets or after diet change. The 13C stable isotope proved to be a reliable marker for differentiating wild and laboratory-reared A. fraterculus flies. © 2019 Florida Entomological Society. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

We implemented a mechanistic approach to isolate the effects of soil hydraulic properties (K-θ-h) of layered soils on water balance components and land and water productivity, adopting comprehensive scenarios of soil water availability and requirements. The agro-hydrological simulations were performed using the SWAP model integrated with the WOFOST crop growth module. The simulated scenarios included the rainfed crop growth of maize and soybean in three climate zones, evaluating the current climate scenarios as well as two future scenarios, a wetter and a drier one, totaling 108 scenarios simulated for 30 years each. Simulations were performed for six soils, grouped pairwise (3 × 2), where each pair represented the same soil group with two different long-term land uses: natural forest (proxy of a no-tillage system) and conventional agricultural use. The K-θ-h relationships were obtained simultaneously by inverse modeling for the full range of soil water contents commonly found in the domain of crop available water. The agro-hydrological simulations showed that the soil hydraulic properties affect dynamically water balance components and land productivity by relating soil hydraulic functioning to climate patterns and crop water requirements. In general, maize productivity was more sensitive to soil hydraulic properties under future climate scenarios than soybean. While land productivities of maize and soybean increased under the wetter climate scenario, water productivity of both crops was consistently reduced by both future climate scenarios. The K-θ-h of soils under conventional agricultural use over-performed their counterparts under long-term natural forest use, especially regarding land productivity during growing seasons with pronounced dry spells. Depending on the length and timing of drought stress during the growing season, the yield response is determined by soil-specific conditions strictly related to water availability. The long-term average revealed that the sampled loamy sand soils have more favorable hydraulic properties for crop growth; moreover, the reduced unproductive water losses, especially runoff, increased the dynamic water storage of those soils. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

The goal of this study was to test the CSA in urban (Brasília and Piracicaba) and in rural (Ubatuba and Maraã) areas. The hair C and N isotope ratios of modern dogs were compared with those of human fingernails from different regions of Brazil. Our CSA results showed a correlation between dog and human isotopes values: in rural areas δ15N of humans and dogs was not statistically different; contrarily, in urban centres, δ15N of humans was approximately 1 ‰ higher (p < 0.01) than δ15N of dogs; humans had lower δ13C values (p < 0.01) than dogs in Brasília, Piracicaba and Ubatuba. In Maraã, there was not any significant difference between dogs and humans. We concluded that CSA is still valid as a first approach in modern societies. However, isotopic differences found suggest that in modern societies processed dog food is increasingly disconnecting human and dog, jeopardising the use of CSA in the future if the trend of increasing processed dog food consumption continues to occur. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Recent studies have shown that plant hormones also strongly influence metabolic networks, which results in altered growth phenotypes. Modulating auxin signalling pathways may therefore provide an opportunity to alter crop performance. Here, we performed a detailed physiological and metabolic characterization of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) mutants with either increased (entire) or reduced (diageotropica—dgt) auxin signalling to investigate the consequences of altered auxin signalling on photosynthesis, water use, and primary metabolism. We show that reduced auxin sensitivity in dgt led to anatomical and physiological modifications, including altered stomatal distribution along the leaf blade and reduced stomatal conductance, resulting in clear reductions in both photosynthesis and water loss in detached leaves. By contrast, plants with higher auxin sensitivity (entire) increased the photosynthetic capacity, as deduced by higher V                             cmax                              and J                             max                              coupled with reduced stomatal limitation. Remarkably, our results demonstrate that auxin-sensitive mutants (dgt) are characterized by impairments in the usage of starch that led to lower growth, most likely associated with decreased respiration. Collectively, our findings suggest that mutations in different components of the auxin signalling pathway specifically modulate photosynthetic and respiratory processes.                          © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	Article	Scopus

The multi-energy calibration (MEC) method was proposed aiming at simplifying the calibration process in atomic spectrometric techniques and making matrix matching feasible. MEC requires preparation of standards by mixing sample aliquots with either a blank or a reference solution, which is not easy to perform for solid samples, especially when complex matrices are involved. In particular for LIBS, this strategy can be hindered by sample heterogeneity and differences in particle size distribution. In turn, sample preparation by fusion is an interesting approach to minimize these drawbacks. In this context, this work proposed MEC and borate fusion as alternatives for quantitative analysis of high silicon content samples by LIBS. Boron and lithium, constituents of the flux, were used as internal standards (ISs) aiming at minimizing strong absorption effects caused by matrix components and improving the accuracy of the results. The accuracy and precision of MEC-LIBS was demonstrated by determining Al2O3, Fe2O3, and TiO2 in SRM 2703 (sediment for solid sampling) and SRM 679 (brick clay); relative errors from -4 to 15% and relative standard deviations (RSD) between 4.0 and 7.0% were attained, showing that the approach is feasible for quantitative analysis of complex samples. The limits of detection were between 0.4 and 0.6% for all analytes. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.	Article	Scopus

Still, classifying LULC in ecotones, where landscapes are commonly heterogeneous and have a wide range of physiognomies, remains a challenge. Here we present a three-level hierarchical classification approach, using both Landsat and MODIS images, and both pixels and objects as units of information. We applied this multi-temporal and -spatial approach to classify land use in the Upper Xingu River Basin (∼170,000 km                             2                             ), located in the arc of deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon. The first level includes five classes and differentiates managed land from native vegetation with high overall accuracy (93%). The second level has 11 classes (overall accuracy = 86%) and separates main land uses and native vegetation domains. The third level has 16 classes (overall accuracy = 83%) and addresses productivity of both managed and natural systems. We find that this new method presented here is more efficient than existing regional and global land cover products. Applying this approach to assess land cover transitions in the basin from 1985 to 2015, we find that agricultural production increased, yet manifested itself differently in the northern (Amazon biome) and southern (Cerrado biome) portions of the basin. Analyzing land use change in different levels, we identify that agricultural intensification occurred mainly in the Amazon while the Cerrado has undergone an expansion in agricultural area. The method presented here can be adapted to other regions, improving efficiency and accuracy of classifying land cover in heterogeneous landscapes.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Eighteen three-month-old Santa Ines castrated male lambs (16.9 ± 1.43 kg of body weight) were randomly distributed in two experimental treatments: Infected with T. colubriformis (I, n = 9) and Uninfected (U, n = 9). The I lambs received a total of 45,000 L3 larvae of T. colubriformis (5,000 infective larvae, three times per week for three weeks). Daily feed intake was assessed using the I lambs as a reference for their respective pairs on the U group (pair-fed). Weight, body condition score and faeces (stool) samples were obtained every 15 days for 75 days. In both treatments, faecal egg count (FEC), digesta passage rate, rumen fermentation parameters, protozoa count and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) were evaluated. The lambs presented moderate infection (FEC = 620). The retention time of the digesta in the rumen-reticulum segment was lower (P < 0.05) in I lambs. The I lambs presented no inappetence, however, lower concentrations of total SCFA and butyrate, while higher acetate concentration were observed in these lambs (P < 0.05). The present findings highlight that T. colubriformis infection decreased the retention time (solid and liquid content) of the digesta in the rumen-reticulum, as well as negatively affected lamb growth. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Methanol concentrations higher than 0.20% (m/m) reduce the biofuel efficiency. The Brazilian, United States, and European standards recommend the reference method based on gas chromatography with flame ionization detection, which involves a time-consuming procedure and requires high-cost equipment. In this work, it is proposed a simple and low cost spot test based on digital images acquired with a smartphone camera for the determination of methanol in biodiesel. The procedure was based on the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and subsequent reaction with Schiff reagent, resulting in a violet product. Analytical signals were based on the reflected radiation measured on the G channel (RGB system), which refers to the complementary color of the reaction product. Linear responses were obtained within 20–500 mg kg−1 and 500–2000 mg kg−1 methanol for 600 and 150 µL of sample aqueous extracts, respectively. The coefficient of variation (n = 10) and the limit of detection (99.7% confidence level) were estimated as 4.8% and 10 mg kg−1 (600 µL of sample), respectively. The procedure requires only 75 µg of potassium permanganate, 6 mg of oxalic acid, and 1.5 mg of p-rosaniline and generates ca. 1.2 mL of residue per determination. The results agreed with those obtained by the reference procedure at the 95% confidence level, demonstrating that the proposed method is an alternative for routine analysis of the biofuel. © 2018	Article	Scopus

Therefore, laboratory studies were performed to evaluate the effects of diuron, hexazinone and sulfometuron-methyl alone and mixed upon carbon transformation by soil microorganisms in clayey and sandy soils and the effect on bacterial diversity and structure. Control treatment without herbicide application was also performed. Sub-samples from the control and herbicide treatments (10 g–in triplicate) were collected before herbicide application and 7, 14, 28 and 42 days after treatment (DAT), then 1 mL of 14C-glucose solution was applied. The released 14CO2 was trapped in 2 M NaOH solution and the radioactivity was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting (LSC), 12 h after glucose application. The effect of herbicides on bacterial diversity was evaluated by T-RFLP. The experiment was conducted in a complete randomized design. Hexazinone did not affect 14CO2 evolution. Diuron showed a greater 14CO2 evolution in sandy and clayey soil, while sulfometuron-methyl led to an increase in sandy soil, at 42 DAT. A greater evolution of carbon was observed in the treatment with herbicide mixture in sandy soil, compared with the same treatment in clayey soil or control. However, the herbicide mixture application did not affect the soil biological activity measured by the respiration rate induced by substrate. On the other hand, the herbicide mixtures affected the bacterial diversity in both soils, being the strongest effect to diuron and sulfometuron-methyl in clayey soil and hexazinone in sandy soil. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) were isolated from the root nodules of Phaseolus lunatus and grown in Cr-contaminated soil with the application of composted tannery sludge. Soils were collected from the experimental field with the application of composted tannery sludge (CTS) in five rates: 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 t ha−1 CTS. Bacterial strains were isolated and evaluated for their biochemical capabilities for production of urease, protease, amylase, lipase, catalase, gelatinase, and indole-3-acetic acid, P solubilization, and Cr tolerance. A total of 54 PGPB were isolated from the nodules, being 40%, 37%, 13%, and 10% found in the treatments with 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 t ha−1, respectively. The majority of these isolates presented positive responses for the tests of urease, catalase, and phosphate solubilization, while some isolates were positive for the test of protease, lipase, carboxymethyl cellulose, gelatinase, and amylase. We also observed a decrease in the number of isolates able to tolerate high concentration of Cr. Three strains (UFPI-LCC61, UFPI-LCC64, and UFPI-LCC87) presented high biochemical capability and tolerance to Cr. However, the isolate UFPI-LCC87 showed high biochemical capability and tolerance to the highest concentration of Cr. Our results indicated bacterial strains that present potential to be used in soils contaminated with Cr and also for promoting plant growth. © 2019, Università degli studi di Milano.	Article	Scopus

Chloroplast differentiation and activity are highly regulated by light, and several proteins involved in these processes have been characterised. Such is the case of the GOLDEN 2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors, which induces the expression of genes related to chloroplast differentiation and photosynthesis. The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) genome harbours two copies of this gene, SlGLK1 and SlGLK2, each with distinct expression patterns. While the former predominates in leaves, the latter is mainly expressed in fruits, precisely at the pedicel region. During tomato domestication, the selection of fruits with uniform ripening fixed the mutation Slglk2, nowadays present in most cultivated varieties, what penalised fruit metabolic composition. In this study, we investigated how SlGLK2 is regulated by light, auxin and cytokinin and determined the effect of SlGLK2 on tocopherol (vitamin E) and sugar metabolism, which are components of the fruit nutritional and industrial quality. To achieve this, transcriptional profiling and biochemical analysis were performed throughout fruit development and ripening from SlGLK2, Slglk2, SlGLK2-overexpressing genotypes, as well as from phytochrome and hormonal deficient mutants. The results revealed that SlGLK2 expression is regulated by phytochrome-mediated light perception, yet this gene can induce chloroplast differentiation even in a phytochrome-independent manner. Moreover, auxin was found to be a negative regulator of SlGLK2 expression, while SlGLK2 enhances cytokinin responsiveness. Additionally, SlGLK2 enhanced chlorophyll content in immature green fruits, leading to an increment in tocopherol level in ripe fruits. Finally, SlGLK2 overexpression resulted in higher total soluble solid content, possibly by the regulation of sugar metabolism enzyme-encoding genes. The results obtained here shed light on the regulatory network that interconnects SlGLK2, phytohormones and light signal, promoting the plastidial activity and consequently, influencing the quality of tomato fruit. © 2019 Lupi et al.

These limitations directly hinder sample throughput and sensitivity. In this work, a simple and inexpensive approach is proposed for separation of volatile analytes by microdistillation. It consists of an eppendorf type tube containing the acceptor solution suspended inside a 50 mL Falcon® capped tube containing the sample. The bottom of the sample tube is submitted to controlled heating in a water bath to promote analyte volatilization to the headspace, thus favoring its collection into the acceptor solution. The efficiency of the approach was evaluated by determination of methanol in biodiesel, whose threshold limit is 0.2% (m/m) according the current legislation. Measurements were based on discoloration of an acidic potassium permanganate solution (750 μL), caused by oxidation of methanol with consequent reduction to Mn(II). The analytical measurements were based on intensity of the reflected radiation acquired as digital images by the camera of a smartphone under controlled lighting. Values of the G channel were used as analytical parameter because of the complementarity with the color of the potassium permanganate solution. Under heating at 70 °C for 40 min, the transference of methanol to the acceptor solution was estimated at (98 ± 3)%. A linear response was achieved within 0.025% and 0.200% (m/m) methanol, with coefficient of variation (n = 10) and limit of detection (99.7% confidence level) estimated at 3.7% and 0.009% (m/m) respectively. The procedure requires only 100 μg of potassium permanganate and 200 μL of sample and generates as low as 950 μL of residue per determination. Because of the selectivity provided by microdistillation, the results obtained by the proposed approach agreed with the reference procedure at the 95% confidence level. The proposed approach is a simple, efficient, and cost-effective alternative for separation and determination of volatile species. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

The reactions catalyzed by lignocellulolytic enzymes are oxidative and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excess of ROS can cause serious damages to cells, including cell death. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the lignocellulolytic enzymes produced by Pleurotus sajor-caju CCB020, Phanerochaete chrysosporium ATCC 28326, Trichoderma reesei RUT-C30, and Aspergillus niger IZ-9 grown in sugarcane bagasse and two yeast extract (YE) concentrations and characterize the antioxidant defense system of fungal cells by the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Pleurotus sajor-caju exhibited the highest activities of laccase and peroxidase in sugarcane bagasse with 2.6 g of YE and an increased activity of manganese peroxidase in sugarcane bagasse with 1.3 g of YE was observed. However, P. chrysosporium showed the highest activities of exoglucanase and endoglucanase in sugarcane bagasse with 1.3 g of YE. Lipid peroxidation and variations in SOD and CAT activities were observed during the production of lignocellulolytic enzymes and depending on the YE concentrations. The antioxidant defense system was induced in response to the oxidative stress caused by imbalances between the production and the detoxification of ROS. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

The MEC method uses only two calibration standards and several atomic emission wavelengths with different sensitivities to determine the analyte concentration in the sample. Both calibration mixtures are prepared using the same amount of sample, which contributes to minimizing matrix effects. The MEC-LIBS method was used to determine Ca, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn in complex-matrix samples of cattle mineral supplements with an adequate sample throughput (15 samples per h). The limits of detection (LODs) calculated for these elements in the solid sample were 11 g kg−1, 45, 188, 53 and 44 mg kg−1, respectively. For Cu, Mn and Zn, these LODs were approximately 10, 10, and 20 times lower than the minimum level required in a commercial product by the Brazilian legislation. The method's accuracy was evaluated by analyzing five reference materials (RM) of cattle mineral supplements, and by comparing values determined in six commercial samples with results from ICP-OES determinations. No statistically significant difference was observed between MEC-LIBS and RM or ICP-OES-determined values at the 95% confidence level (Student's t-test, n = 3). LIBS is an inherently atomic-emission-rich technique, which suffers from severe matrix effects. MEC is an efficient matrix-matching method, for which the larger the number of analytical signal sources for an analyte the more precise the results. Therefore, MEC is a highly compatible, complementary approach to LIBS calibration. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.	Article	Scopus

The presence of this vegetation in small and sparse areas in Paraná, Southern Brazil, can be associated with its past climate conditions. Paleoenvironmental changes of Cerrado vegetation in the Campo Mourão region (24º06’S-52º23’W) are discussed in this study. The environmental changes were characterized using proxy data that includes stable isotopes and phytolith analyses in peaty sediments. Two drill cores obtained in alluvial plains were analyzed. Results were compared with the isotopic record (δ¹³C) from a trench in the Cerrado Ecological Station. Based on the results, we can infer that in ~48,800±270 yrs BP, the vegetation was mainly composed of grasses and at ~42,280 cal yrs BP a wetter climate allowed the expansion of arboreal vegetation. During the Middle Holocene (~7280 cal yrs BP), a drier period is also reported. Current climatic conditions (wet) were established since ~3280 cal yrs BP, after which the data suggests the expansion of subtropical forests over the Cerrado. © 2019, Sociedade Brasileira de Paleontologia.

However, recent researches demonstrated that herbicides used to kill cover crop could decrease N status in the straw, reducing the nutrient availability to the cash crop. In this context, the aim of this work was to investigate the effect of glyphosate or glufosinate-ammonium application in K, P, Ca, Mg, S and C status in plant's tissues of black oat (Avena strigosa) and peal millet (Pennicetum glaucum) desiccated with herbicides. An experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions using a factorial design 2x3. The evaluated factors were cover crop (black oat or peal millet) and cover crop management (1-Control- mechanical cut, without herbicide application; 2-Glyphosate- cover crop desiccation with glyphosate; 3-Glufosinate- cover crop dessication with ammonium-glufosinate). Dry mass production, nutrients accumulation in plants part and entire plants and the nutrient's utilization efficiencies were determined. The nutrients accumulation in plants was not reduced by herbicides; however, a lower dry matter and C accumulation was observed after herbicides application. Glyphosate increased K, P, S and C remobilization from leaves to stalks, but glufosinate did not affect it, suggestion a lower effect of this herbicide in nutrients availability to cash crop. Herbicides did not affect K, P, Ca, Mg and S losses from plants, thus the total amount of these nutrients in the system should be not affected by glyphosate or ammonium glufosinate utilization. However, since glyphosate changes these nutrients distribution among plant's parts, increasing nutrients in the stalks and reducing nutrients in the leaves of pearl millet, it may affect nutrient availability to cash crops, since leaves mineralization is faster than stalks mineralization on soil.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of genetic group, pregnancy, age and their interactions on carcass traits, meat quality and fatty acid profile in sheep. Methods: Eighty-five Santa Ines ewes and their crosses with Texel, Dorper and Ile de France, aged 12 month were bred with White Dorper rams to assess the influence of pregnancy on carcass composition and meat quality. After weaning, all ewes (nulliparous and primiparous) were fattened for slaughter at 21 months of age. A further 24 six to twenty one-month-old female lambs from the same genetic groups were included in the analysis to determine the fatty acid profile. Results: Genetic group affected muscle and fat weight as well as the eye muscle length. Fat weight, muscle and fat ratios, subcutaneous fat thickness and cooking loss were affected by pregnancy with nulliparous females being fatter. Meat purpose breeds such as Dorper, Texel and Ile de France showed better meat quality compared to the Santa Ines hair breed. Of the 19 identified fatty acids, saturated were present in greater quantities, especially stearic and palmitic. Omega-6 content was influenced by age and pregnancy. Conclusions: Younger and nulliparous females have better carcass quality in terms of fatty acid composition. © 2019 Revista Colombiana de Ciencias Pecuarias. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial C:N:P ratio in soil across three different physiognomies of Cerrado in the Northeast, Brazil, namely campo graminóide (dominance of grasses), cerrado stricto sensu (dominance of grasses, shrubs, low trees, and woody stratum), and cerradão (dominance of woody stratum). Campo graminóide was characterized by lower values of total organic C, N, microbial C:P, N:P, and soil C:N. Cerrado stricto sensu presented average values for most of the measured parameters, while cerradão presented higher values of microbial C, N, P, organic C, N and soil C:P and C:N ratios. The principal component analysis showed that the samples grouped according to the sites, with a clear gradient from campo graminóide to cerradão. Therefore, the differences of vegetation across physiognomies of Cerrado influenced the soil microbial C:N:P ratio, where cerradão showed highest microbial C:N:P ratio than soil under campo graminóide. © 2019, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

Twenty crossbred castrated male pigs, with average body weight of 70.00±1.95 kg, distributed in a randomized block design with four treatments and five repetitions (blocks) were used to evaluate apparent total tract digestibility of dietary nutrients. To evaluate animal performance and carcass traits, eighty commercial hybrids pigs with 120 days of age and average body weight of 73.00±3.3 kg were used. Pigs were distributed in 40 boxes according to gender and body weight, with one castrated male and one female pig per pen (experimental unit), in a randomized block design with 10 repetitions (blocks) per treatment were used. Regarding the digestibility assay, Tifton hay presented 2425 kcal of digestible energy/kg, with low digestible protein content (3.36%). Citrus pulp presented 2850 kcal of digestible energy/kg, also with low digestible protein content (1.47%). Soybean hulls showed 2250 kcal of digestible energy/kg, with relatively medium crude protein digestibility coefficient (7.85%). Offering different fiber sources in the finishing phase for pigs promoted significant differences (p<0.05) in animal performance parameters (daily weight gain, daily feed intake and feed conversion) and no significant effect (p>0.05) was observed for carcass parameters. Given the results obtained in this study, Soybean hull showed to be a promising ingredient to be used in diets of finishing pigs, leading to good results on animal performance and also contributing to the sustainability of pig production. © 2019 Ah Reum Son, Hyunwoong Jo, Kyu Ree Park and Beob Gyun Kim.

Several genes have been described as encoding components of the plant cell development machinery, among which are the plant peptides. Here we describe a novel cysteine-rich plant peptide (68 amino acids), encoded by a small open reading frame gene (sORF). It is specifically expressed in the reproductive organs of Nicotiana tabacum and is developmentally regulated. N- and C-terminal translational fusions with GFP in protoplasts have demonstrated that the peptide is not secreted. Knockdown transgenic plants produced by RNAi exhibited enlarged pistils due to cell expansion and the gene was named Small Peptide Inhibitor of Cell Expansion (SPICE). Estimation of nuclear DNA content using flow cytometry has shown that cell expansion in pistils was not correlated with endoreduplication. Decreased SPICE expression also affected anther growth and pollen formation, resulting in male sterility in at least one transgenic plant. Our results revealed that SPICE is a novel reproductive organ specific gene that controls cell expansion, probably as a component of a signal transduction pathway. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

The effect of combinations of packaging atmospheres (loose or vacuum-packed) and storage temperatures (4±1 °C or 24±2 °C) on the tendency of lipid radical formation and on volatiles was investigated for the first time in shelled Brazil nut kernels. It was observed that refrigeration, whether combined with lose packing or vacuum packing, was effective to reduce the tendency for lipid radical formation, as detected by spin-trapping electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, as well as peroxides, conjugated dienes and 3-octen-2-one. However, the combination of refrigeration with vacuum packing, even using low-density polyethylene (LDPE) pouches with a high oxygen transmission rate (OTR), also reduced the formation of hexanal, which is a major off-flavor volatile, and thus should be recommended for the storage of Brazil nut kernels for the studied period. © 2018 CSIC.

The emission of isoprene gas – a trait shared by one-third of tree species – is known to protect leaf biochemistry under climatic stress. Here, we test the hypothesis that isoprene emission shapes tree species compositions in tropical forests by enhancing the tolerance of emitting trees to heat and drought. Using forest inventory data, we estimated the proportional abundance of isoprene-emitting trees (pIE) at 103 lowland tropical sites. We also quantified the temporal composition shifts in three tropical forests – two natural and one artificial – subjected to either anomalous warming or drought. Across the landscape, pIE increased with site mean annual temperature, but decreased with dry season length. Through time, pIE strongly increased under high temperatures, and moderately increased following drought. Our analysis shows that isoprene emission is a key plant trait determining species responses to climate. For species adapted to seasonal dry periods, isoprene emission may tradeoff with alternative strategies, such as leaf deciduousness. Community selection for isoprene-emitting species is a potential mechanism for enhanced forest resilience to climatic change. © 2018 The Authors.

As DREB genes have been constantly associated with abiotic stress tolerance, we systematically categorized 54 putative PvDREB genes distributed in the common bean genome. It involved from AP2 domain location and amino acid conservation analysis (valine at the 14th position) to the identification of conserved motifs within peptide sequences representing six subgroups (A-1 to A-6) of PvDREB proteins. Four genes (PvDREB1F, PvDREB2A, PvDREB5A, and PvDREB6B) were cloned and analyzed for their expression profiles under abiotic stresses and their nucleotide and amino acid diversity in genotypes of Andean and Mesoamerican origin, showing distinct patterns of expression and nucleotide variability. PvDREB1F and PvDREB5A showed high relative inducibilities when genotypes of common bean were submitted to stresses by drought, salt, cold, and ABA. PvDREB2A inducibility was predominantly localized to the stem under drought. PvDREB6B was previously described as an A-2 (DREB2) gene, but a detailed phylogenetic analysis and its expression profile clearly indicated it belongs to group A-6. PvDREB6B was found as a cold- and dehydration-responsive gene, mainly in leaves. Interestingly, PvDREB6B also showed a high nucleotide and amino acid diversity within its coding region, in comparison to the others, implicating in several nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions between Andean and Mesoamerican genotypes. The expression patterns and nucleotide diversity of each DREB found in this study revealed fundamental characteristics for further research aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with drought, salt, and cold tolerance in common bean, which could be performed based on association mapping and functional analyses.

The Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein (NRAMP) family plays an essential role in divalent metal transport. We conducted bioinformatics approaches to identify seven NRAMP genes in the Phaseolus vulgaris genome, investigated their phylogenetic relation, and performed transmembrane domain and gene/protein structure analyses. We found that the NRAMP gene family forms two distinct groups. One group included the PvNRAMP1,-6, and-7 genes that share a fragmented structure with a numerous exon/intron organization and encode proteins with mitochondrial or plastidial localization. The other group is characterized by few exons that encode cytoplasmic proteins. In addition, our data indicated that PvNRAMP6 and-7 may be involved in mineral uptake and mobilization in nodule tissues, while the genes PvNRAMP1,-2,-3,-4 and-5 are potentially recruited during plant development. This data provided a more comprehensive understanding of the role of NRAMP transporters in metal homeostasis in P. vulgaris. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.	Article	Scopus

The objective of this work was to evaluate and determine the possible causes of this and propose alternative herbicides to use. Glyphosate was applied at three plant stages of development (2–4 leaves, 4–6 leaves and full bloom) where foliar absorption and translocation of glyphosate to various plants parts and time were analysed using the 14C technique. Data were submitted to nonlinear regressions and analysis of variance, where means were compared by a Tukey test at 5% probability. Plant control by the application of different herbicides (19) in the same three stages of development of weed was evaluated. Twenty-one days after herbicide application, control was visually evaluated and data analysed and means were compared. Due to absorption and/or translocation problems, S. verticillata plants were not controlled by glyphosate. Plants with 4–6 leaves showed lower absorption and translocation of the herbicide to the leaf/root regions compared with plants at the beginning of their development. Plants at full bloom showed lower translocation of the herbicide to the root. In addition to the application of glyphosate at early stages of development, the application of paraquat, flumioxazin and mixtures of glyphosate with flumioxazin or cloransulam is recommended. Late applications could result in poor control, principally if glyphosate is used. Therefore, early applications are strongly recommended for control of this species. © 2018 European Weed Research Society	Article	Scopus

This quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) method was modified and provided good analytical results (recoveries ranged from 79 to 119%, RSDs <21% and LOQs below the established maximum level). Popcorn samples were contaminated with fumonisins, aflatoxin B1, neosolaniol and T-2 toxin, with mean concentrations of 592, 10.2 and 10.2 μg kg−1, respectively, while cornflake samples were contaminated with only T-2 (mean 11.2 μg kg−1). The co-occurrence of fumonisin B1+ aflatoxin B1 was observed in 52% of popcorn samples and was not observed in cornflake samples. The estimated intake for the Brazilian population of total fumonisins and T-2 toxin for popcorn as the upper bound approach were 0.0051 and 0.00004 μg kg −1 bw day −1, respectively, and for the 99th percentile were 0.1943 and 0.0014 μg kg −1 bw day −1, respectively, suggesting a low risk of ingestion. However heavy consumers may be exposed to a potential risk due to fumonisins (upper bound of 4.6 μg kg−1 bw day−1). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

A study was conducted to test the hypothesis that sites varying in historical usage of by-product differ in soil N-supplying power and sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) responsiveness to N fertilization. Our aim was to quantify soil N availability and N fertilizer rates, sources, and application timings for their effects on sugarcane yield and NUE. Three N response trials, each involving 0 to 200 kg N ha–1, were conducted in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, at sites varying historically in the usage of vinasse. Before fertilizer application and at harvest, soil inorganic N content was quantified and potential N mineralization estimated by the Illinois Soil Nitrogen Test (ISNT); stalk yield and sugar content were measured at harvest and used to estimate NUE. Sugarcane showed significant response to N fertilization only at the sites with no history of vinasse usage. Reducing the N rate from 120 to 80 kg N ha–1 showed limited potential for lowering yield (~ 1 %), while increasing the NUE by 54 %, which was far better than the 14 % increase achieved by modifying the N source or application timing. Monitoring inorganic N and ISNT levels over time to estimate soil N-supplying power has potential for predicting the responsiveness of sugarcane to N fertilization; however, ISNT interpretations must consider factors that impede mineralization or crop N utilization, such as soil acidity or a limitation on the availability of Ca or P. Soil N testing can help optimize NUE for sustainable bioenergy production. © 2018, Scientia Agricola. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

Therefore, the antifungal activity of Eucalyptus staigeriana, Lippia sidoides and Pimenta pseudocaryophyllus essential oils (EOs) was tested in vitro against Colletotrichum gloesporiodes, the causal agent of anthracnose in papaya. The EO with the highest activity was evaluated regarding its chemical composition, in vivo activity and its effects on papayas post-harvest quality, when associated with a carboxymethylcellulose coating. L. sidoides EO presented the highest in vitro antifungal activity, with thymol as the predominant compound in its composition. In vivo, the fruit treated with CMC associated with L. sidoides EO presented a reduction in disease severity and maintained post-harvest parameters, besides slowing the appearance of rot and shriveling in the fruit on the ninth day of storage, whereas in the control and treatment with only CMC, this behavior occurred on the fifth and seventh days, respectively. Thus, the association of L. sidoides EO with CMC was effective in the rise of papayas shelf life, preserving their post-harvest characteristics for nine days, indicating that this treatment can be considered a viable alternative for the extension of the fruit commercialization period. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Despite its global importance, estimates of SNF rates are highly uncertain, particularly in tropical forests where rates are assumed to be high. Here we provide a framework for evaluating the uncertainty of sample-based SNF estimates and discuss its implications for quantifying SNF and thus understanding of forest function. We apply this framework to field data sets from six lowland tropical rainforests (mature and secondary) in Brazil and Costa Rica. We use this data set to estimate parameters influencing SNF estimation error, notably the root nodule abundance and variation in SNF rates among soil cores containing root nodules. We then use simulations to gauge the relationship between sampling effort and SNF estimation accuracy for a combination of parameters. Field data illuminate a highly right-skewed lognormal distribution of SNF rates among soil cores containing root nodules that were rare and spanned five orders of magnitude. Consequently, simulations demonstrated that sample sizes of hundreds to even thousands of soil cores are needed to obtain estimates of SNF that are within, for example, a factor of 2 of the actual rate with 75% probability. This represents sample sizes that are larger than most studies to date. As a result of this previously undescribed uncertainty, we suggest that current estimates of SNF in tropical forests are not sufficiently constrained to elucidate forest stand-level controls of SNF, which hinders our understanding of the impact of SNF on tropical forest ecosystem processes. © 2018 by The University of Chicago.

While aboveground biodiversity is often well studied, the belowground microbiome, in particular protists, remains largely unknown. Indeed, holistic insights into soil microbiome structures in natural soils, especially in hyperdiverse biomes such as the Brazilian Cerrado, remain unexplored. Here, we study the soil microbiome across four major vegetation zones of the Cerrado, ranging from grass-dominated to tree-dominated vegetation with a focus on protists. We show that protist taxon richness increases towards the tree-dominated climax vegetation. Early successional habitats consisting of primary grass vegetation host most potential plant pathogens and least animal parasites. Using network analyses combining protist with prokaryotic and fungal sequences, we show that microbiome complexity increases towards climax vegetation. Together, this suggests that protists are key microbiome components and that vegetation succession towards climax vegetation is stimulated by higher loads of animal and plant pathogens. At the same time, an increase in microbiome complexity towards climax vegetation might enhance system stability. © 2018, The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

However, little is known about how mineral oil behaves when in contact with the soil. Thus, the objective of this research was to evaluate the transport of atrazine via leaching with the addition of mineral oil in a soil agricultural under laboratory conditions. To quantify the concentration of the herbicide along the profile of the very clay soil column (30 cm),14C-atrazine (ring-U-14C) was used with 16,667 Bq of radioactivity per column in volume of 200 mL solution and 0 (control), 1, and 2% mineral oil (v/v) was added in the application volume. Atrazine was applied at the highest commercial dose recommended for sugarcane (4 kg ha-1). After simulation of a precipitation of 200 mm for 48 h, each column was sectioned into six parts of 5 cm and the analytes of each soil sample and the leachate were quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The atrazine remained in the superficial layer of the soil, between 0 and 10 cm of depth, independent of the addition of mineral oil. No atrazine residues were detected in the leachate solution (> 30 cm) in any evaluated treatment. The addition of mineral oil at the time of application of pre-emergence atrazine did not interfere with the transport of this herbicide in the soil profile agricultural via leaching; therefore, the adjuvant may have positive effect only in the herbicide-plant relationship. © 2019, Sociedade Brasileira da Ciencia das Plantas Daninha.

We performed acute and chronic assays, and analyzed the organisms by μ-XRF and μ-XANES. In acute assays 25 nm nCuO (LC50 0.05 ± 0.011 mg Cu per L) and CuSO4 (LC50 0.16 ± 0.015 mg Cu per L) were most toxic, while 40 nm and 80 nm nCuO had similar toxicity (LC50 2.34 ± 0.479 and 2.26 ± 0.246 mg Cu per L, respectively). In chronic assays, CuSO4 (EC50 1.7 × 10-4 ± 1.0 × 10-4 mg Cu per L) was most toxic followed by 25 nm nCuO (EC50 1.8 × 10-3 ± 8.0 × 10-4 mg Cu per L), while 40 and 80 nm nCuO were least toxic (EC50 2.10 ± 0.669 and 1.95 ± 0.568 mg Cu per L, respectively). μ-XRF showed that Cu was accumulated in the intestine and appendages of the daphnids. μ-XANES showed that 25 nm nCuO and CuSO4 were biotransformed into Cu3(PO4)2 (acute assays), whereas 40 and 80 nm nCuO remained as CuO (chronic assays). The higher toxicity exhibited by CuSO4 and 25 nm nCuO can be explained from their higher chemical reactivity (probed by catalytic decomposition of H2O2 and μ-XANES) compared to 40 and 80 nm nCuO. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.

X-ray fluorescence microanalysis (μ-XRF) can reveal the elemental distribution pattern along these rings. However, reports on quantitative μ-XRF methods targeted to wood analysis are scarce. This study aimed to analyze iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P) in annual tree-rings of wood cores cut from 24 trees of 17 year-old Pinus taeda planted in soil amended with six doses of composted pulp-mill sludge (CPMS). The nutrient concentrations were accessed using calibration curves built with spiked P. taeda wood pellets. Calcium and Mn content decreased from the pith to bark direction; K and S decreased from the pith up to 3rd tree-ring and, then, increased to the bark. Iron and P slight decreased from the pith up to the 13–14th tree-ring. Calcium, K and S presented strong and positive correlation with the rainier and hotter season (r > 0.4, p < 0.05). The CPMS increased the Ca, K, Fe and S and decreased Mn and P concentration in P. taeda wood in the 2nd–5th years. Furthermore, the P. taeda annual tree-ring molar ratios of Ca/Mn and K/Ca were good indicators of soil-pH and wood cambium activity. The μ-XRF methodology, as non-destructive method of nutrient concentration analysis in tree-rings, revealed potential uses in monitoring soil fertilizer treatments. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH	Article	Scopus

Transcription factors are major players in the regulation of water stress-related genes in plants. Recently, different MYB transcription factors were characterized for their involvement in drought response. A sugarcane R2R3-MYB gene (ScMYBAS1) and its four alternative forms of transcript (ScMYAS1-2, ScMYBAS1-3, ScMYBAS1-4 and ScMYBAS1-5) were identified in this study. The subcellular localization, in Nicotiniana benthamiana, of the TFs fused in frame with GFP revealed that ScMYBAS1-2-GFP and ScMYBAS1-3-GFP were observed in the nucleus. The overexpression of ScMYBAS1-2 and ScMYBAS1-3 spliced transcripts in rice promoted change in plant growth under both well-watered and drought conditions. The ScMYBAS1-2 and ScMYBAS1-3 transgenic lines revealed a higher relative water content (RWC) compared to the wild type before maximum stress under drought conditions. The ScMYBAS1-2 transgenic lines showed a reduction in biomass (total dry weight). Conversely, ScMYBAS1-3 showed an increased biomass (total dry weight) relative to the wild-type. The overexpression of ScMYBAS1-3 in rice transgenic lines showed involvement with drought tolerance and biomass and, for this reason, was considered a good target for plant transformation, particularly for use in developing genotypes with drought tolerance and biomass accumulation. © 2018 Fávero Peixoto-Junior et al.

However, although various studies and advances have been conducted to understand the cellulolytic system and the transcriptional regulation of T. reesei, the whole set of genes related to lignocellulose degradation has not been completely elucidated. In this study, we inferred a weighted gene co-expression network analysis based on the transcriptome dataset of the T. reesei RUT-C30 strain aiming to identify new target genes involved in sugarcane bagasse breakdown. In total, ~70% of all the differentially expressed genes were found in 28 highly connected gene modules. Several cellulases, sugar transporters, and hypothetical proteins coding genes upregulated in bagasse were grouped into the same modules. Among them, a single module contained the most representative core of cellulolytic enzymes (cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase, ß-glucosidase, and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase). In addition, functional analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) revealed various classes of hydrolytic activity, cellulase activity, carbohydrate binding and cation:sugar symporter activity enriched in these modules. Several modules also showed GO enrichment for transcription factor activity, indicating the presence of transcriptional regulators along with the genes involved in cellulose breakdown and sugar transport as well as other genes encoding proteins with unknown functions. Highly connected genes (hubs) were also identified within each module, such as predicted transcription factors and genes encoding hypothetical proteins. In addition, various hubs contained at least one DNA binding site for the master activator Xyr1 according to our in silico analysis. The prediction of Xyr1 binding sites and the co-expression with genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes and sugar transporters suggest a putative role of these hubs in bagasse cell wall deconstruction. Our results demonstrate a vast range of new promising targets that merit additional studies to improve the cellulolytic potential of T. reesei strains and to decrease the production costs of 2G ethanol. © 2018 Borin, Carazzolle, dos Santos, Riaño-Pachón and Oliveira.

Aiming to elucidate whether functional specialization is a ubiquitous feature of eucalypts, we focused on its changes with ontogeny, tree nutrient status and soil depth. We studied the potential uptake of N, K and Ca by 2-year-old E. grandis trees, as a function of soil depth and NPK fertilization. We injected NO−3-15N, Rb+ (K+ analogue) and Sr2+ (Ca2+ analogue) tracers simultaneously in a solution at depths of 10, 50, 150 and 300 cm in a sandy Ferralsol soil. A complete randomized block design was set up with three replicates of paired trees per injection depth, in fertilized and non-fertilized plots. Recently expanded leaves were sampled at 70 days after tracer injection. Determination of foliar Rb, Sr concentrations and x(15N) allowed estimating the relative uptake potential (RUP) and the specific RUP (SRUP), defined as the ratio between RUP and fine root length density (RLD) in the corresponding soil layer. Various root traits were measured at each depth. Foliar N and K concentrations were higher in fertilized than in non-fertilized trees. The RUP of NO3                             –-15N decreased sharply with soil depth and the highest values of the SRUP of NO3                             –-15N were found at a depth of 50 cm. The RUP of Rb+ and Sr2+ did not change with soil depth, whilst the SRUP of Rb+ and Sr2+ were higher at the depth of 300 cm than in the topsoil, concomitant with an increase in root diameter and a decrease in root tissue density with depth. The SRUP of Rb+ and Sr2+ at a depth of 300 cm were on average 136 and 61% higher for fertilized trees than for non-fertilized trees, respectively. Fine roots of young E. grandis trees showed contrasting potential uptake rates with soil depth depending on the nutrient. Fertilization increased the uptake rate of Rb+ and Sr2+ by unit of root length in deep soil layers. Functional specialization of fine roots for cations of low mobility depending on depth previously shown at harvesting age also occurs in young E. grandis plantations and increases with fertilization application. This mechanism helps explaining very low amounts of cations lost by leaching in Eucalyptus plantations established in deep tropical soils, even in highly fertilized stands. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here we describe two new genera based on two new species, Inacoccus gen. nov. based on Inacoccus carmineus sp. nov. and Cryptococcum gen. nov. based on Cryptococcum brasiliense sp. nov. Both genera have morphological features typical of the genus Chroococcus and are based on strains isolated from terrestrial habitats of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Inacoccus differs from Chroococcus in forming nanocytes and by producing an intensely red-coloured sheath. Cryptococcum is a cryptic genus and two species, C. brasiliense and C. komarkovaum, have been recognized by a molecular approach (16 rRNA and 16S-23S ITS sequences). The 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny indicates that these proposed genera form monophyletic clades apart from the Chroococcus sensu stricto cluster. Additionally, the tropical species Chroococcus subviolaceus was studied by molecular methods for the first time. The results confirmed a vast phylogenetic diversity hidden under the simple morphology of Chroococcus morphotypes, and show that terrestrial environments are a promising field of research. © 2019, © 2019 British Phycological Society.

Previous studies have debated the relative contributions of increasing wetter and warmer climate conditions and human landscape modifications to forest expansion, but generally lacked high resoltiuon proxies to measure these effects, or have relied on single proxies to reconstruct both climate and vegetation. Here, we develop and test a model of natural ecosystem distribution against vegetation histories, paleoclimate proxies, and the archaeological record to distinguish human from temperature and precipitation impacts on the distribution and expansion of Araucaria forests during the late Holocene. Carbon isotopes from soil profiles confirm that in spite of climatic fluctuations, vegetation was stable and forests were spatially limited to south-facing slopes in the absence of human inputs. In contrast, forest management strategies for the past 1400 years expanded this economically important forest beyond its natural geographic boundaries in areas of dense pre-Columbian occupation, suggesting that landscape modifications were linked to demographic changes, the effects of which are still visible today. © 2018 The Author(s).

These are considered one of the main pathogens, causing significant economic losses, such as in peppers and guarana. The current forms of control include the use of resistant cultivars, sanitary pruning and fungicides. However, even with the use of some methods of controlling these cultures, the crops are not free of anthracnose. Additionally, excessive application of fungicides increases the resistance of pathogens to agrochemicals and cause harm to human health and the environment. In order to find natural antifungal agents against guarana anthracnose, endophytic fungi were isolated from Amazon guarana. The compounds piliformic acid and cytochalasin D were isolated by chromatographic techniques from two Xylaria spp., guided by assays with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The isolated compounds were identified by spectrometric techniques, as NMR and mass spectrometry. This is the first report that piliformic acid and cytochalasin D have antifungal activity against C. gloeosporioides with MIC 2.92 and 2.46 μmol mL−1 respectively. Captan and difenoconazole were included as positive controls (MIC 16.63 and 0.02 μmol mL−1, respectively). Thus, Xylaria species presented a biotechnological potential and production of different active compounds which might be promising against anthracnose disease. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia	Article	Scopus

This will further enhance the validity of the measurement results and contribute significantly to the quality assurance of plant nutrition analysis. The candidate reference material obtained had a low residual moisture and appropriate particle size. Neutron activation analysis was used to determine the mass fraction of Al, Br, Ca, Cl, Ce, Co, Cs, Cu, Fe, Hf, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sm, Sr, Th, V and Zn, and the Kjeldahl method for N. Statistical techniques were applied to evaluate minimum sample mass and within-bottle homogeneity (ANOVA, Tukey test and PCA) and between-bottles homogeneity (ANOVA). It is demonstrated in this paper that the material is homogeneous using 50 mg mass sample for most chemical elements. However, sample masses of 200 mg or greater are required for Co, Na, Sb and V. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	Article	Scopus

High Al concentrations can cause physiological and structural changes, leading to symptoms of toxicity in plant tissue. The aim of this study was to describe the Al toxicity in soybean plants through physiological, nutritional, and ultrastructure analyses. Plants were grown in nutrient solution containing increasing Al concentrations (0; 0.05; 0.1; 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mmol L−1). The Al toxicity in the soybean plants was characterized by nutritional, anatomical, physiological, and biochemical analyses. The carbon dioxide assimilation rates and stomatal conductance were not affected by the Al. However, the capacity for internal carbon use decreased, and the transpiration rate increased, resulting in increased root biomass at the lowest Al concentration in the nutrient solution. The soybean plants exposed to the highest Al concentration exhibited lower root and shoot biomass. The nitrate reductase and urease activities decreased with the increasing Al concentration, indicating that nitrogen metabolism was halted. The superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities increased with the increasing Al availability in the nutrient solution, and they were higher in the roots, showing their role in Al detoxification. Despite presenting external lesions characterized by a damaged root cap, the root xylem and phloem diameters were not affected by the Al. However, the leaf xylem diameter showed ultrastructural alterations under higher Al concentrations in nutrient solution. These results have contributed to our understanding of several physiological, biochemical and histological mechanisms of Al toxicity in soybean plants. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS	Article	Scopus

Areas that have been cultivated with perennial pasture for decades may have nutritional deficiencies and lack a sufficient population of atmospheric nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Molybdenum is an essential micronutrient that is part of the enzyme nitrogenase contained within symbiotic Bradyrhizobium bacteria, which are responsible for fixing nitrogen in legumes. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of application of Mo at different rates and a rhizobial inoculant on peanut growth characteristics. The experiment was conducted in the 2009/2010 growing season in a no-tillage cropping system following 20-year use as pasture [Urochloa brizantha (Syn. Brachiaria brizantha)]. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replicates. The main plots were characterized by peanut inoculation with Bradyrhizobium inoculant or without, and the split plots were characterized by different rates of molybdenum (0, 50, 100, and 200 g ha-1) applied to leaves in the form of ammonium molybdate. The nutritional status of plants, nodulation (number of nodules and nodule dry matter per plant), nitrogenase activity, and nitrogenase specific activity were evaluated at 45 and 64 days after emergence (DAE). The yield components and kernel yield were evaluated at the end of the growing season. Nitrogenase enzyme activity at 64 DAE approximately doubled, and the number of pods per plant was greater with inoculation than without, both of which led to greater yields of pods and kernels. In long-term pasture areas, inoculation and molybdenum fertilization greater than the currently recommended rate appear to be necessary to increase pod and kernel yield per hectare of peanut when managed under no-tillage.

In comparison, the mitochondrial genome of plants is much larger and more plastic and could contain increased phylogenetic signals. We assembled a consensus reference mitochondrion with Illumina TruSeq synthetic long reads and Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION long reads. Based on this assembly we also analyzed the mitochondrial transcriptomes of sugarcane and sorghum and improved the annotation of the sugarcane mitochondrion as compared with other species. Methods: Mitochondrial genomes were assembled from genomic read pools using a bait and assemble methodology. The mitogenome was exhaustively annotated using BLAST and transcript datasets were mapped with HISAT2 prior to analysis with the Integrated Genome Viewer. Results: The sugarcane mitochondrion is comprised of two independent chromosomes, for which there is no evidence of recombination. Based on the reference assembly from the sugarcane cultivar SP80-3280 the mitogenomes of four additional cultivars (R570, LCP85-384, RB72343 and SP70-1143) were assembled (with the SP70-1143 assembly utilizing both genomic and transcriptomic data). We demonstrate that the sugarcane plastome is completely transcribed and we assembled the chloroplast genome of SP80-3280 using transcriptomic data only. Phylogenomic analysis using mitogenomes allow closely related sugarcane cultivars to be distinguished and supports the discrimination between Saccharum officinarum and Saccharum cultum as modern sugarcane's female parent. From whole chloroplast comparisons, we demonstrate that modern sugarcane arose from a limited number of Saccharum cultum female founders. Transcriptomic and spliceosomal analyses reveal that the two chromosomes of the sugarcane mitochondrion are combined at the transcript level and that splice sites occur more frequently within gene coding regions than without. We reveal one confirmed and one potential cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) factor in the sugarcane mitochondrion, both of which are transcribed. Conclusion: Transcript processing in the sugarcane mitochondrion is highly complex with diverse splice events, the majority of which span the two chromosomes. PolyA baited transcripts are consistent with the use of polyadenylation for transcript degradation. For the first time we annotate two CMS factors within the sugarcane mitochondrion and demonstrate that sugarcane possesses all the molecular machinery required for CMS and rescue. A mechanism of cross-chromosomal splicing based on guide RNAs is proposed. We also demonstrate that mitogenomes can be used to perform phylogenomic studies on sugarcane cultivars.

Chronic contamination has been associated with biofilms that are normally more resistant to antimicrobials and cleaning efforts than planktonic cells. In this study, contaminant species of Lactobacillus isolated from biofilms (source of sessile cells) and wine (source of planktonic cells) from industrial and pilot-scale fermentations were compared regarding their ability to form biofilms and their sensitivity to different antimicrobials. Fifty lactobacilli were isolated and the most abundant species were Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus plantarum. The majority of the isolates (87.8%) were able to produce biofilms in pure culture. The capability to form biofilms and sensitivity to virginiamycin, monensin and beta-acids from hops, showed inter- and intra-specific variability. In the pilot-scale fermentation, Lactobacillus brevis, L. casei and the majority of L. plantarum isolates were less sensitive to beta-acids than their counterparts from wine; L. brevis isolates from biofilms were also less sensitive to monensin when compared to the wine isolates.

Yet, while climate-induced biodiversity changes are widely documented elsewhere, few studies have addressed this issue for lowland tropical ecosystems. Here we investigate whether the floristic and functional composition of intact lowland Amazonian forests have been changing by evaluating records from 106 long-term inventory plots spanning 30 years. We analyse three traits that have been hypothesized to respond to different environmental drivers (increase in moisture stress and atmospheric CO                             2                              concentrations): maximum tree size, biogeographic water-deficit affiliation and wood density. Tree communities have become increasingly dominated by large-statured taxa, but to date there has been no detectable change in mean wood density or water deficit affiliation at the community level, despite most forest plots having experienced an intensification of the dry season. However, among newly recruited trees, dry-affiliated genera have become more abundant, while the mortality of wet-affiliated genera has increased in those plots where the dry season has intensified most. Thus, a slow shift to a more dry-affiliated Amazonia is underway, with changes in compositional dynamics (recruits and mortality) consistent with climate-change drivers, but yet to significantly impact whole-community composition. The Amazon observational record suggests that the increase in atmospheric CO                             2                              is driving a shift within tree communities to large-statured species and that climate changes to date will impact forest composition, but long generation times of tropical trees mean that biodiversity change is lagging behind climate change.                          © 2018 The Authors.

There is increasing evidence of the preventative and protective roles of anthocyanins against a broad range of pathologies, including different cancer types and metabolic diseases. However, most of the fresh produce available to consumers typically contains only small amounts of anthocyanins, mostly limited to the epidermis of plant organs. Therefore, transgenic and non-transgenic approaches have been proposed to enhance the levels of this phytonutrient in vegetables, fruits, and cereals. Here, were review the current literature on the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in model and crop species, including the structural and regulatory genes involved in the differential pigmentation patterns of plant structures. Furthermore, we explore the genetic regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis and the reasons why it is strongly repressed in specific cell types, in order to create more efficient breeding strategies to boost the biosynthesis and accumulation of anthocyanins in fresh fruits and vegetables. © 2018	Review	Scopus

This study aimed to compare the water retention capacity of the canopy in two watersheds an entirely covered by Atlantic Forest (Rain Forest), located in “Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar” and other covered with Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis in an adjacent area. Monitoring was carried out in the years of 2008 and 2009 through rain gauges and the water retention of the forest canopy was evaluated from linear regressions between precipitation (PR) and internal elevation (TR). The results showed that, with the exception of interception in the “dry” season that presented the lowest coefficients of determination (R2), being 77% in the eucalypt and 82% in the Atlantic Forest, the variables presented a good fit with the incident precipitation, with higher coefficients of 90%. The Atlantic Forest showed higher retention capacity of water in relation to Eucalyptus, where rainfall lower than 5 mm in the Atlantic Forest and 0.78mm in eucalypt are fully intercepted by the forest canopy and the wet period presented the greatest water retention capacity, probably due to the greater vegetation regeneration at this time, since in the dry period the leaves fall can decrease the retention. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

The objective of this study was to investigate phosphorus (P) retention in broilers fed diets formulated with different feed ingredients. Sixty-four 15-d old broiler chicks were fed diets in which part of the dietary P was provided from dicalcium phosphate, maize, barley or soybean. Level of supplementation of each ingredient was calculated to provide two levels of total P (4.5 or 5.0 g kg–1 feed). Birds received a single injection of 3 MBq of32P to determine endogenous P excretion using the isotope dilution technique. Four days after injection, blood and excreta were collected for analysis of inorganic and radioactive P. There were no differences among diets in total (p = 0.37) or endogenous (p = 0.65) P excretion or in P retention (p = 0.37) regardless of the supplemental feed material used in each diet. Daily P retention was increased (p = 0.004) as P intake increased, but the proportion of P ingested that was retained was not affected (p = 0.23) by the level of dietary P. The use of an isotopic tracer allows for accurate estimation of endogenous P in excreta, ranging from 0.24 to 0.42 mg P g–1 dry matter intake. The retention of P in growing chickens was not changed when 10-20 % of total P was provided by maize, barley or soybean. © 2018, Scientia Agricola. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

Sample treatment, ion-pair extraction, and photometric detection with a smartphone camera were carried out in a single vessel, thus significantly simplifying the procedure and minimizing risks of contamination and analyte loss. The chloroform volume for both sample treatment and extraction of the ion-pair was only 150 μL and usual drawbacks of LLME, such as the need for phase isolation and dilution of the extract before spectrophotometric measurements were avoided. By using sodium dodecylsulfate as a model surfactant, and only 100 μL of sample, 25 μg of methylene blue, and 2.9 mg of EDTA, a linear response was achieved from 10 to 50 mg L−1, r = 0.999 (n = 5), with detection limit (99.7% confidence level) and coefficient of variation of 2.2 mg L−1 and 1.9% (n = 10), respectively. The proposed procedure is a simple, fast, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly approach for detection of milk adulterations by surfactants. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

To evaluate ammonia (N-NH3) losses, N-fertilizer recovery and grain yield as a function of urea sidedress timing in corn, a field study was conducted during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 growing seasons, adopting a complete randomized block design with four replications. Treatments consisted of urea sidedress timing (140 kg N ha-1) at V4, V6, V8, V10, and V12 growth stages, plus a control without sidedress N. The largest N losses by N-NH3 volatilization occurred when urea was applied at V10 or V12 growth stages, reaching losses of 35 and 41 % of the total applied N. Although climatic factors influences N-NH3 volatilization process, crop characteristics such as canopy development also seems to affect N-NH3 losses. Nitrogen application at V4 or V6 growth stages resulted in greater N-fertilizer recovery from urea sidedress, reaching values of 53 %. No increase in corn grain yield was observed with N application at different corn growth stages during the two growing seasons evaluated, most likely due to high N mineralization rates from the soil. © 2018, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

Spores (5.7 × 106 spores) of different Bt strains (907, 1192, 2036, 2493, 2496, and S1185) plus a control (no spores) were used as treatments with four replicates (inocula) in duplicate. Fermentation processes were evaluated and ruminal microorganisms were quantified. Compared with the control, the Bt907 strain decreased dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) degradability without affecting the Fibrobacter succinogenes population, whereas the other strains reduced this population without altering DM and OM degradability. © 2019, Agricultural Institute of Canada.

Different indexes of NUE, grain yield, nutrient uptake and partitioning in maize (Zea mays L.) were investigated in field experiments. The treatments consisted of a single rate of 180 kg N ha−1 with different proportions of polymer-sulfur coated urea (PSCU) and conventional urea (U) applied incorporated at sowing (0.05 m below and 0.1 m to the side of the seed row) at two tropical sites (Site 1, Typic Haplustox; Site 2, Rhodic Haplustox) in Brazil. A control treatment (without urea-N) and a treatment with conventional urea management (UCM: 20% of urea-N applied as basal fertilizer and 80% of N applied as top dressing) were also included. This study demonstrates that blends of PSCU and U are efficient in supplying N throughout the maize cycle at a Typic Haplustox site when applied in a single application incorporated at sowing, resulting in high yields and adequate macronutrient uptake. PSCU improved NUE index compared to U and UCM. There was not response for N fertilization in the Rhodic Haplustox site. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

However, few prior studies have investigated the effect of gamma irradiation on the dissipation of pesticides in foods, especially insecticides in beans. This study aimed to evaluate the waste dissipation of two insecticides, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, used in the cultivation of common bean, a variety of Carioca, using gamma irradiation. Ground bean samples were spiked each insecticide in the laboratory at 3, 4, and 5 mg/kg, and were then irradiated at 0, 1, and 2 kGy per irradiator with a 60Co source. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify the insecticides. The irradiation promoted dissipation of thiamethoxam at 1 and 2 kGy doses, with the highest dissipation verified at 2 kGy. In general, at this higher dose of irradiation the reduction dissipation of thiamethoxam was 66% of the mean value found in the treatment without irradiation and ∼44% relative to the 1 kGy dose. Conversely, imidacloprid showed no effect of irradiation on waste dissipation, except in the treatment of 5 mg/kg at 2 kGy dose. From the results, it was concluded that the gamma irradiation might have applicability in dissipating thiamethoxam in real bean samples. Practical Application: Pesticide residues remaining from bean cultivation, sensitive to optimal doses of gamma irradiation, can be transformed into other less harmful or nonharmful substances, increasing the quality of the beans before the food arrives at the consumer's table. Irradiation of the grains after harvest also eliminates the need for application of other pesticides to preserve the grains during storage, as the technique is capable of eradicating deteriorating agents, such as microorganisms and insects. © 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®	Article	Scopus

Despite being known to scholars since the end of the nineteenth century, shell mounds were recurrently considered marginal to the cultural developments in the neighboring state of Rio de Janeiro. Scarce information on the contents of the sites and the lack of well-referenced14C dating prevented a complete understanding of the time-depth and evolution of pre-colonial settlement on this fragment of the Brazilian coast. This paper introduces the aims and preliminary results of renewed archaeological research on the shell mounds of the northern coast of Espírito Santo, in the municipality of Linhares. Two shell mounds have been excavated thus far, pushing the record of human presence on the coast back by almost 2000 years. The new research follows a standardized method of excavation specially designed for initial characterization of shell mound deposits; this method involves creating a digital database and incorporating computerized methods for excavation management. Signs of human presence were seen along the northern coast before the Holocene maximum transgression (Suruaca site, dated c. 6800 cal. BP), when mangroves, restingas, and the Atlantic rainforest comprised the coastal environment. © 2018 Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

The common practice in PTF generation is to randomly separate the dataset into training and testing subsets, and the outcomes of this random selection may be different if the process is subject to covariate shift. We evaluated the impact of covariate shift generated by data shuffling and detected by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for the prediction of water contents using soil databases from Denmark and Brazil. The soil water contents at different pressure heads were predicted by developing linear and stepwise regression besides machine learning based PTFs including Gaussian process regression and ensemble method. Regression based PTFs for the Brazilian dataset resulted in better predictions compared with machine learning methods, which in their turn estimated high water contents in Danish soils more accurately. One hundred PTFs were developed for water content at specific pressure heads by data shuffling. From these, 100 sets of fitted van Genuchten parameters were obtained representing the generated uncertainty. Data shuffling led to covariate shift, resulting in uncertainty in water content prediction by the PTFs. Inherent variability of data may lead to increased prediction uncertainty. For correlated data, simple regression models performed as good as sophisticated machine learning methods. Using PTF-predicted water contents for van Genuchten retention parameter fitting may lead to a high uncertainty. © 2019 The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

The resulting genome is ca. 5.9 Mbp in length and resembles the size of previously published C. beijerinckii genomes. We annotated the genome sequence and predicted a total of 5323 genes. Strain Br21 has a genetic toolkit that allows it to exploit diverse sugars that are often found after lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment to yield products of commercial interest. Besides the whole set of genes encoding for enzymes underlying hydrogen production, the genome of the new strain includes genes that enable carbon sources conversion into butanol, ethanol, acetic acid, butyric acid, and the chemical block 1,3-propanediol, which is used to obtain polymers. Moreover, the genome of strain Br21 has a higher number of ORFs with predicted beta-glucosidase activity as compared to other C. beijerinckii strains described in the KEGG database. These characteristics make C. beijerinckii strain Br21 a remarkable candidate for direct use in biotechnological processes and attest that it is a potential biocatalyst supplier. © 2019, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.

In 2004, Groenevelt and Grant (GRT) presented a mathematical model for describing the SWRC and reported its mathematical versatility and good fit to soils from a Dutch database. In order to evaluate the application of GRT to SWRCs of Brazilian soils, we aimed to analyze the performance of GRT for 72 soils from Brazil. Besides that, the obtained results with GRT for these soils were compared to the fitting performance of the most frequently used models: Brooks and Corey (BC) and van Genuchten-Mualem (VGM). The three models were fitted to available soil water retention data by minimizing the sum of square errors. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used to assess the goodness-of-fit. Results showed high correlation coefficients (r≥0.95) and small values of RMSE (RMSE ≤0.03 cm3 cm−3) for all fits. The goodness-of-fit was of similar performance for the three models with a positively correlation between them. The major difference in shape among GRT, BC, and VGM occurred in the near saturated range, while they were almost identical for low matric potentials. The exponent of GRT showed to be highly correlated with exponents of BC and VGM, but the correlation between the other shape parameters is not well defined, making a direct conversion still difficult. © Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo 2019.

However, measuring soil matric potential requires a tensiometer reading system sensitive enough to accurately record the matric potential. Hence, an instantaneous profile-type experiment was conducted in the field, to measure the soil matric potentials within a moisture range from saturation to field capacity. After that, matric potential, soil moisture, total potential gradient, flow density and hydraulic conductivity were calculated and van Genuchten equation parameters were estimated through inverse modeling. This study aimed to test the Bourdon pressure gauge and digital tensiometer compared with the mercury manometer to measure the soil matric potential and to examine the differences related to the estimations of soil water content and to the associated variables. In addition, the study also aimed to evaluate soil hydraulic parameters by inverse modeling, based on the matric potentials from each reading system. Bourdon pressure gauge replaces the Hg manometer in the measurement of soil water matric potential within the moisture range from saturation to field capacity; The use of digital tensiometer and Bourdon pressure gauge reduced hydraulic conductivity by four and three times and flow density by approximately three and two times, respectively, at 6 kPa tension and, therefore, are not recommended for the estimation of these hydraulic parameters; Regardless of reading system used in the tensiometer, inverse modeling estimates well van Genuchten equation parameters and, consequently, soil water matric potential. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This flour can be used as ingredient for gluten-free cereal products with higher nutritional value. For this it is necessary to preserve the anthocyanin content during thermal processing and shelf-life periods. At time 0, the dose of 3 kGy provided all of the most available bioactive compounds, raising their antioxidant potential, except for TPC. During the storage at different temperatures up to 120 days, gradual losses occurred in all the analysed parameters. Regarding the total anthocyanin content and TPC, the sample irradiated with a 1 kGy dose remained most stable. The analysis of kinetic data indicated a first-order reaction for the degradation of anthocyanins. The combination of irradiation with different temperatures may improve the shelf-life of black rice flour. © 2018 by the authors.

The use of nanoparticles (NPs) in agriculture is promising, but in-depth knowledge on their interaction with plants is required. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different concentrations (1-5000 mg L-1) and sizes (20, 40, and 60 nm) of uncoated ZnO NP compared to ionic ZnSO4 (positive control) on common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) seed germination. The seeds were soaked in ZnO NP aqueous dispersions for 20 min. The ZnO nanoparticles did not affect the germination rate. The 10 mg L-1 40 nm ZnO treatment showed a tendency to increase weight after 5 days (8.26 ± 0.11 g) when compared to the negative control (7.7 ± 0.7 g). However, at 5000 mg L-1 40 nm ZnO NP and ZnSO4 weight was reduced to 7.7 ± 0.8 g and 6.05 ± 0.08 g, respectively. Microprobe X-ray fluorescence showed that most of the Zn absorbed was trapped in the seed coat, while a small fraction entered the cotyledon. X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicated the biotransformation of the ZnO NP. In the hilum and cotyledon, Zn was found associated with organic molecules such as citrate, malate, and histidine-like compounds. Seedling weight reduction depended on the concentration of Zn taken up by the tissue and on the biotransformation of ZnO into organically bound Zn. Considering the properties of the studied NP, in particular the slow Zn release and lower toxicity compared to ZnSO4, the results represent a step forward toward the application of ZnO NP as an agrochemical. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

By means of the tests carried out in the distillation system using acetone as a reference, advantages and disadvantages were found with increasing/decreasing the temperature used in the process. From the use of gas chromatography, it was possible to obtain a more precise control of the quality of the recovered product and also to verify the high efficiency of the distillation process in the separation of the solvent from the other contaminants present in the waste. And in terms of comparison of treatments, distillation proved to be environmentally more sustainable and about 8 times more economical than incineration. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

Consequently, a good understanding of this process is essential to determine mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate the risk of water contamination around areas with sugarcane crops. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the leaching of ametryn, diuron, hexazinone, and metribuzin by using columns in five soils with different physicochemical properties cultivated with sugarcane. The radiolabeled herbicides with14 C were evaluated at six soil depths (0-0.05, 0.05-0.10, 0.10-0.15, 0.15-0.20, 0.20-0.25, and 0.25-0.30 m) and in the leachate after 200 mm rainfall simulation for 48 h. Herbicide leaching was mostly affected by soil type. Ametryn and diuron were reported in the highest amount (>87%) on the topsoil (0-0.05 m), which was indicative of the low leaching of these two herbicides in the soil profile. Thus, these herbicides can contaminate surface water by runoff. Leachate percentage was always <0.3% for ametryn, diuron, and metribuzin; this was also the case for hexazinone in two out of the five soils. Hexazinone proved to be a potential contaminant of groundwater and metribuzin presented high leaching in the soil profile. Previous knowledge of the physico-chemical properties of soils cultivated with sugarcane is essential to recommend the use of these herbicides in weed management. © 2019, Sociedade Brasileira da Ciencia das Plantas Daninha.

The responses to these studies are ordinal categorical variables, thus, they are normally based on a hedonic scale. Generally, in sensory experiments, each judge evaluate several products and the answers given by the same judge can be classed as repeated measures. In this paper, we propose an alternative statistical analysis to consider the natural ordering and repeated measures simultaneously using proportional odds mixed models. Such models were proposed to compare the taste acceptance of two varieties of tomato, Italian and Sweet Grape, after the osmotic dehydration process. The experiment was designed in the way that each judge, randomly selected and evaluated each variety once. The results showed that the Sweet Grape presented better acceptance than Italian variety. This model allowed the predictions and estimations probabilities to be calculated for each of the response categories according to each variety. Practical applications: Tomate is a product highly perishable and new dehydration techniques are being developed and needs to have good accepted by consumers. In this paper, we proposed an alternative statistical model to compare the taste acceptance of two varieties of dehydrated tomato, Italian and Sweet Grape. The model presented can be used in different sensorial evaluations and can help researchers to analyze ordinal categorical data, focusing on how to identify and account for specific issues arising from experimental design (such as correlated observations). The results showed that the Italian tomato was 6.89 times more likely to be classified with lower scores at hedonic scale compared to Sweet Grape tomato regardless of sex. The Sweet Grape variety has a probability of 44% (32%; 57%) of receiving score 9 and for Italian variety this happens with a probability equal of 10% (5%; 19%). In addition, the results showed no significant correlation between responses from the same judge. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	Article	Scopus

Nitrogen (N) is a macronutrient that is usually limiting to plant yield; however, molecular mechanisms of plant acclimation to N limitation remain largely unknown in tropical woody crops. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome of coffee roots under N starvation, analyzing poly-A+ libraries and small RNAs. We also evaluated the concentration of selected amino acids and N-source preferences in roots. Ammonium was preferentially taken up over nitrate, and asparagine and glutamate were the most abundant amino acids observed in coffee roots. We obtained 34,654 assembled contigs by mRNA sequencing, and validated the transcriptional profile of 12 genes by RT-qPCR. Illumina small RNA sequencing yielded 8,524,332 non-redundant reads, resulting in the identification of 86 microRNA families targeting 253 genes. The transcriptional pattern of eight miRNA families was also validated. To our knowledge, this is the first catalog of differentially regulated amino acids, N sources, mRNAs, and sRNAs in Arabica coffee roots. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Some hypotheses point to the direct activity of the metazoans, such as the predation of microorganisms that formed the microbial mats, as the reason for the decrease in the occurrence of microbialites since the beginning of Phanerozoic. However, this hypothesis is controversial due to the lack of direct evidence pointing to metazoan effects. Abundant subrecent microbialites and modern microbial mats occur in the Holocene lagoon Lagoa Salgada, Brazil, and its association with metazoans is remarkable. This contribution describes the various modern and fossil microbial biofacies and elucidates the paleoenvironmental evolution. It also investigates whether any interaction between the microbial communities and metazoans affected the morphology of the microbialites. Three biofacies were defined: (i) carbonate-cemented microbialites (CC), (ii) non-cemented planar microbial mats (NC-PM), and (iii) noncemented cauliflower-shaped microbial mats (NC-CM). Biofacies (ii) and (iii) form biofilm catenae in the S and the SW margin of the lagoon, as a reflection of the current dynamics and relief of the lagoon. The microtextures of the biofacies are described in petrological thin sections analyses and X-ray microtomography. The mineralogy and elemental distribution were analyzed by SEM/EDS and l-XRF. 14C dating shows that the microbialites were established 2973-3383 cal. yr BP. During that time period the lagoon experienced a greater marine influence. Metazoans associated with microbialites and microbial mats include herbivorous, detritivorous, and opportunistic specimens. They occur filling voids and pores and also the fabrics of the microbialites and microbial mats. Although external factors such as the sedimentary evolution of the lagoon, the closure of the lagoon, its loss of connection with the sea, and the physicochemical changes during the whole process have caused prohibitive effects on the development of the microbialites, the metazoans appear to have a crucial effect on the framework of the bioconstructions, especially during the period with the greatest abundance of metazoans living in association with the microbial mats.

Articles can be published in a complex variety of journals that differ in their presentation format (online-only or in-print), editorial organizations that maintain them (commercial and/or society-based), editorial handling (academic or professional editors), editorial board composition (academic or professional), payment options to cover editorial costs (open access or pay-to-read), indexation, visibility, branding, and other aspects. Additionally, online submissions of non-revised versions of manuscripts prior to seeking publication in a peer-reviewed journal (a practice known as pre-printing) are a growing trend in biological sciences. In this changing landscape, researchers in biochemistry and molecular biology must re-think their priorities in terms of scientific output dissemination. The evaluation processes and institutional funding for scientific publications should also be revised accordingly.

To establish infection, phytopathogens interfere with plant immune responses [2, 3]. However, strategies to promote virulence employed by fungal pathogens, especially non-model organisms, remain elusive [4], mainly because fungi are more complex and difficult to study when compared to the better-characterized bacterial pathogens. Equally incomplete is our understanding of the birth of microbial virulence effectors. Here, we show that the cacao pathogen Moniliophthora perniciosa evolved an enzymatically inactive chitinase (MpChi) that functions as a putative pathogenicity factor. MpChi is among the most highly expressed fungal genes during the biotrophic interaction with cacao and encodes a chitinase with mutations that abolish its enzymatic activity. Despite the lack of chitinolytic activity, MpChi retains substrate binding specificity and prevents chitin-triggered immunity by sequestering immunogenic chitin fragments. Remarkably, its sister species M. roreri encodes a second non-orthologous catalytically impaired chitinase with equivalent function. Thus, a class of conserved enzymes independently evolved as putative virulence factors in these fungi. In addition to unveiling a strategy of host immune suppression by fungal pathogens, our results demonstrate that the neofunctionalization of enzymes may be an evolutionary pathway for the rise of new virulence factors in fungi. We anticipate that analogous strategies are likely employed by other pathogens. Fiorin et al. demonstrate that two fungal pathogens of cacao independently evolved catalytically dead chitinases that bind to chitin and prevent elicitation of plant immunity. The study exemplifies how pathogens may evolve effectors by repurposing the functions of enzymes that are conserved throughout evolution. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

These places are globally widespread and their soils are an important environmental component controlling chemical reactions in wetland ecosystems. Here, we present a pedogenic study of two HTFs on the Brazilian coast (northeast and southeast) based on the solid-phase geochemistry of Fe and Mn and morphological studies. Broken and irregular topographies and strong expression of redoximorphic concentrations (e.g., mottles, nodules, and pore linings) are present throughout the soil profiles. Although lepidocrocite is the most abundant Fe fraction in these soils (more than 50% of all extractions), deeper horizons show pyrite as the main Fe fraction caused by the presence of buried mangrove soils. The more oxidizing conditions in these deeper horizons indicate that pyrite is not stable and is undergoing degradation. Iron released in this process is moving upward and precipitating as Fe oxides in more oxidized portions of the soil profile. Coprecipitation of Mn and ferrihydrite seems to be an important process controlling the geochemistry of Mn in HTFs. Our data indicate that deeper horizons have been transforming, driven mainly by water table oscillation and, consequently, redox processes. This process allows translocation of Mn2+ and Fe2+ throughout the soil profile, followed by oxidation and precipitation of Mn3+/4+ and Fe3+ oxides in preferential sites. © Soil Science Society of America.

However, in tropical soils such as in Brazil, there are no studies regarding the behavior of pre-emergent herbicides, mainly aminocyclopyrachlor and mesotrione, in SS-amended soil. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of municipal SS applied in agriculture on the sorption-desorption of aminocyclopyrachlor and mesotrione in clay soil. Aminocyclopyrachlor (pyrimidine-2-14C-aminocyclopyrachlor) and mesotrione (cyclohexane-2-14C-mesotrione) sorption-desorption was evaluated using a batch equilibrium method. Soil was amended at 0% (control - unamended), 0.1%, 1%, and 10% (w·w-1) of air-dried SS corresponding to 1.2, 12, and 120 t·ha-1. The Freundlich Kf sorption values of aminocyclopyrachlor and mesotrione were similar for all treatments, ranging from 1.07 to 1.45 and 3.48 to 4.25 µmol(1-1/n) L1/n·kg-1, respectively. Overall, the lowest Kd sorption value of these herbicides was reported for SS-amended soil (1%), while in the SS-amended soil (10%) it was higher than unamended soil. The H value for aminocyclopyrachlor was ~1 (no hysteresis) and for mesotrione was on average 0.4 (hysteresis occurring). In conclusion, the present study indicates that SS applied in any crop to supply nutrients can slightly affect the sorption-desorption of aminocyclopyrachlor and mesotrione, but this small difference does not affect the bioavailability of these herbicides for weed control. © 2019, Agronomic Institute of Campinas.

However, the applications of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NP) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) hybrids has grown considerably, due to their enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. To our knowledge, there are no reports available to the scientific community about their toxicity. In this work, we perform a toxicity assessment of TiO2NP and TiO2-MWCNT nanohybrid materials using Zebrafish embryos standardized 96 h early life stage assay, under different exposure conditions (with and without UV light exposure). After exposure the parameters assessed were acute toxicity, hatching rate, growth, yolk sac size, and sarcomere length. In addition, μ-probe X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (µ-XRF) was employed to observe if nanoparticles were uptaken by zebrafish embryos and consequently accumulated in their organisms. Neither TiO2NP nor TiO2-MWCNT nanohybrids presented acute toxicity to the zebrafish embryos. Moreover, TiO2NP presents sublethal effects for total length (with and without UV light exposure) on the embryos. This work contributes to the understanding of the potential adverse effects of the emerging nanohybrid materials towards safe innovation approaches in nanotechnology. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This property is used in dynamic simulations of vadose zone processes such as soil water availability, surface boundary processes of evaporation and infiltration, and the fate of soil pollutants. The most common measurement technique consists in establishing a hydrostatic equilibrium between an initially saturated soil sample and a porous medium at a certain tension on a tension table or pressure plate. However, there is reasonable doubt about the assumed hydrostatic equilibrium, especially in the dry range at low pressure heads. In this study we compared the traditional pressure plate apparatus protocol to an inverse parameter estimation protocol based on a transient evaporation experiment. Independent pressure head measurements using a dewpoint device were also performed. We sampled a variety of soil textures typical of the Brazilian subtropical humid zones, aiming to show differences between textures in their subjection to hydraulic nonequilibrium. The performed experiments allow to conclude that the two compared protocols showed real pressure heads in samples on a pressure plate to be less negative than the assumed ones, leading to an overestimation of the soil water content in the dry range at low pressure heads, especially in fine-textured soil samples. This affects the reliability of most soil hydraulic databases, derived PTFs in the dry range, as well as the wilting point estimation. Water availability predictions based on total and readily available water are more sensitive to the water retention measurement method when the chosen lower limits of available water are closer to the wilting point. In this sense, irrigation timing criteria based on readily available water should be preferred over total available water, especially for fine-textured soils. Finally, given the low reliability of the pressure plate apparatus for low pressure heads, possibly biasing hydrological simulations and their interpretation, alternative measurement methods for the drier part of the soil water retention curve should be preferred, e.g., the proposed inverse modeling of evaporation experiments. © 2019, ista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

We investigated to what extent the estimated soil hydraulic parameters obtained from inverse modeling of these experiments are reliable. A machine learning based pedotransfer function (PTF) for prediction of water content at −1, −10, and −158 m pressure head was developed. Sensitivity analysis of the van Genuchten parameters (residual and saturated water content qr and qs, fitting parameters α, n, and l, and saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks) in soils of sandy, silty, and clayey textures showed that the temporal variation of pressure heads in ADI scenarios was not sensitive to qr and qs. The other parameters were accurately estimated from numerically synthesized data. The uniqueness of the estimated parameters did not change when a bias, representing experimental error, was added to the data set. In actual columns, using the temporal and spatial pressure head data from the ADIs and the water contents in the drier range predicted by the developed PTF resulted in a precise estimation of the van Genuchten parameters. Not including the PTF water contents resulted in non-uniquely estimated van Genuchten parameters. © 2019 The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

The integration of these data allowed the interpretation of mangrove paleoecology based on pollen content along stratigraphic sequences. Most stratigraphy of the cores indicated a direct relationship between Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) pollen content and tannin content. Some stratigraphic intervals showed a high percentage of R. mangle pollen, which may be interpreted as the mangrove forest mainly being occupied by R. mangle. A decrease of tannin content suggests a decrease of R. mangle density or a late mangrove colonization. The spectrophotometric method using tannin concentrations, proposed in this paper and supported by pollen data, may be considered an additional tool for the paleoenvironmental reconstruction of mangrove areas and an innovative tool that will allow reduction of costs in the studies of paleomangrove environment identification. © 2019 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

Among these activities, agriculture represents a land use that is crucial for human development but also a key driver of stream degradation and biodiversity decline in the tropics. Against this background, we investigated indirect effects of agriculture (alterations in stream flow and nutrient availability) and climate characteristics (water temperature) on benthic biofilm communities in tropical streams (São Paulo State, Brazil). Three first-order streams draining catchments dominated by agricultural land use (sugarcane for bioenergy production, pasture) with some remaining riparian forest were studied for 1 year. We focused on the relationships of benthic biofilm biomass, algal biomass, diatom community, and functional structure with streamflow dynamics, nitrate concentrations, and water temperature. Our results indicate that these biological responses were mainly mediated by flow and water temperature and not by resource availability in the studied headwater streams. This result could be explained by the heavy rains and elevated runoff generation in these tropical catchments under agricultural influence, which might override the known effects of nutrient enrichment on benthic biofilm communities. Considering forecast climate and land-use changes in tropical streams, our findings may suggest potential shifts in benthic biofilm communities, with functional consequences for aquatic food webs in these environments.

The in vitro experiment was conducted as a completely randomized design using the seven contrasting oils. Treatments consisted of a control and 3 increasing concentrations (0, 1, 2, and 5% v/v) of oil added to a tifton 85 hay samples. All vegetable oils linearly decreased (P < 0.01) gas production after 24 h of incubation, with the greatest reduction when 5% of oil was included into the diet. Açaí and buriti had no effect of CH4 (% or mL/g DM incubated) however carrot, macaúba, basil, passionflower, and pequi oil all linearly decreased (P < 0.01) CH4 production with increasing inclusion rate of oil. Pequi oil resulted in the largest decrease in CH4 production (mL/g DM incubated) after 24 h of in vitro incubation. The objective of the in vivo experiment was to evaluate the effects of pequi oil on nutrient digestibility, CH4 production, and rumen fermentation parameters in wethers fed a hay-based diet. The experiment was conducted as a 2 × 2 Latin Square design using 4 Dorper wethers (63.4 ± 1.46 kg body weight). There were 2 experimental periods of 21 d each, with d 1-14 used for diet adaptation and d 15-21 for measurements and collections. The treatments consisted of a control diet and pequi oil fed at 70 g per animal per day. The addition of pequi oil to the diet had no effect on feed intake or the digestibility of nutrients, however there was a numerical decrease in the population of cellulolytic bacteria. There was a tendency (P = 0.06) for pequi oil addition to decrease CH4 production (g/d) by 17.5%. From this study, we can conclude that pequi oil may be used as a suitable oil for reducing CH4 production from ruminants, with no negative effects on intake or digestibility. © 2018 Freitas, Terry, Ribeiro, Pereira, Tomich, Machado, Campos, Corrêa, Abdalla, Maurício and Chaves.

The current study determines the biotechnological potential of endophytic fungi, isolated from leaves of Sapindus saponaria, to control phytopathogenic fungi and evaluate their enzyme production. Molecular taxonomy was performed by sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 ribosomal DNA region, identifying the genera Phomopsis, Sordariomycetes, Diaporthe, and Colletotrichum. In vitro antagonism against phytopathogens showed better results against Fusarium solani and provided inhibition indices between 41.8 % and 67.5 %. The endophytic strain SS81 (Diaporthe citri) presented the highest antagonism index against the pathogen. Against Glomerella sp. and Moniliophthora perniciosa, inhibition rates ranged between 18.7 % and 57.4 % and between 38.3 % and 64.8 %, respectively. Enzyme assays revealed that strain SS65 (Diaporthe sp.) produced 1.16 UI μmol/min of amylase; strain SS77 (Diaporthe sp.) produced 2.74 UI μmol/min of pectinase, and strain SS08 (Diaporthe sp.) produced 1.51 UI μmol/min of cellulase. Thus, the current study shows evidence the importance of isolated endophytes with phytoprotective properties of plants with medicinal properties as alternatives for biological control and natural sources of products with biotechnological interest. © 2019, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Here, we conducted metatranscriptome analysis to determine if and how breeding for resistance of common bean against the root pathogen Fusarium oxysporum (Fox) affected gene expression in the rhizobacterial community. Our data revealed that the microbiome of the Fox-resistant cultivar presented a significantly higher expression of genes associated with nutrient metabolism, motility, chemotaxis, and the biosynthesis of the antifungal compounds phenazine and colicin V. Network analysis further revealed a more complex community for Fox-resistant cultivar and indicated Paenibacillus as a keystone genus in the rhizosphere microbiome. We suggest that resistance breeding in common bean has unintentionally co-selected for plant traits that strengthen the rhizosphere microbiome network structure and enrich for specific beneficial bacterial genera that express antifungal traits involved in plant protection against infections by root pathogens. © 2018, International Society for Microbial Ecology.

Using a stepwise linear model (SWLM) and the Lasso regression as parametric methods with 316 data in training and 135 data in the testing phase, four pedotransfer functions (PTFs) were obtained in which water contents for both methods play an important role compared with other variables. The SWLM showed better performance than Lasso in the testing phase for log(K                             s                             ) and log(K                             10                             ) prediction, with RMSE values of 0.666 and 0.551 cm d                             −1                              and R                             2                              of 0.26 and 0.65. Nonparametric supervised machine learning methods trained and tested with a similar data set significantly improved the accuracy of K                             s                              prediction, with R                             2                              of 0.52, 0.36, and 0.53 for Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine (SVM), and ensemble (ENS) methods in the testing stage.

The mixotrophic haptophyte Prymnesium parvum is one of the most important microalgae associated with fish kills. Here 26 strains of P. parvum with a wide geographical distribution were screened for the production of prymnesins, the suspected causative allelochemical toxins. All investigated strains produced prymnesins, indicating that the toxins play an important role for the organism. The prymnesins can be classified into three types based on the length of the carbon backbone of the compound and each algal strain produced only one of these types. Biogeographical mapping of the prymnesin distribution indicated a global distribution of each type. In addition, phylogenetic analyses based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences revealed monophyletic origin of all prymnesin types and clades could therefore be defined based on the toxic compound. It might be that evolution of new species within the P. parvum species complex is driven by changes in toxin type or that they are a result of it. Such a correlation between chemotype and phylotype has never been documented before for a harmful microalga. Chemotaxonomy and ITS-type classification may thus be used to further delimit the P. parvum species complex. © 2018 The Authors	Article	Scopus

Usually phosphorus (P) is the most limiting nutrient for crop growth in these regions. The aim of this study was to characterize the gene expression profiles of the genotypes of common bean IAC Imperador (P-responsive) and DOR 364 (P-unresponsive) under different P concentrations using RNA-seq transcriptome sequencing technology. Plants were grown hydroponically, with application of two P concentrations (4.00 mg L-1 restrictive level and 8.00 mg L-1 control level). Differential expression analyses, annotation, and functional classification were performed comparing genotypes within each P rate administered and comparing each genotype response to the different P levels. Considering differential expression analyses within genotypes, IAC Imperador exhibited 1538 up-regulated genes under P restriction and 1679 up-regulated genes in the control, while DOR 364 exhibited 13 up-regulated genes in the control and only 2 up-regulated genes under P restriction, strongly corroborating P-unresponsiveness of this genotype. Genes related to phosphorus restriction were identified among the differentially expressed genes, including transcription factors such as WRKY, ERF, and MYB families, phosphatase related genes such as pyrophosphatase, acid phosphatase, and purple acid phosphatase, and phosphate transporters. The enrichment test for the P restriction treatment showed 123 enriched gene ontologies (GO) for IAC Imperador, while DOR 364 enriched only 24. Also, the enriched GO correlated with P metabolism, compound metabolic processes containing phosphate, nucleoside phosphate binding, phosphorylation, and also response to stresses. Thus, this study proved to be informative to phosphorus limitation in common bean showing global changes at transcript level. © 2019 Silva et al.

Otherwise, plant metabolism impaired by Cd toxicity can be aided by a proper sulfur (S) nutrition, since S is a component of antioxidants and photosynthetic systems. In this sense, our aim in this study was to evaluate the effect of S supply (0.1, 1.9 and 3.7 mmol L−1) on the antioxidant and photosynthetic systems of Massai grass exposed to Cd (0.0, 0.1 and 0.5 mmol L−1) as a prerequisite for studies of Cd phytoextraction. Plants supplied with 3.7 mmol L−1 S showed the lowest growth and the highest Cd concentrations when exposed to 0.5 mmol L−1 Cd. However, Massai grass grown without S deprivation showed the highest GSH + GSSG concentrations in all tissues and the lowest lipid peroxidation in stems and sheaths and roots. In general, the activities of SOD, CAT, APX, GPOX and GR did not increase in Massai grass exposed to Cd, even with proper S supply. Severe Cd exposure halted the photosynthetic system of Massai grass, although well-nourished plants with S exhibited greatest photosynthetic rate probably due to the action of GSH in the control of the oxidative stress. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, it is a key factor to consider in studies concerning global climate change and agronomy. Among the main components of SOM are humic substances (HS), which are divided, according to their solubility, into humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), and humin (HU) fractions. Study of the chemical properties of this organic matter is important for understanding the biogeochemical processes occurring in the soil. The aim of this work was to determine the metals iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al), using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), in order to elucidate the role of organic matter in the transport of these metals in Amazonian soils. The results showed that FA was important for Al, while the HA fraction was more selective towards Fe. The translocations of these metals to deeper profiles in two different soils involved either young and less humified organic matter, or older organic matter with a low degree of humification. Therefore, these two humic fractions were involved in the process of soil podzolization, with FA having a predominant role in the transport of Al, while HA was mainly responsible for the transport of Fe. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The CaSMP promoter drives reporter expression in the seeds of immature tomato fruits. Abstract: In this report, an expressed sequence tag-based approach was used to identify a seed-specific candidate gene for promoter isolation in Coffea arabica. The tissue-specific expression of the cognate gene (CaSMP), which encodes a yet uncharacterized coffee seed maturation protein, was validated by RT-qPCR. Additional expression analysis during coffee fruit development revealed higher levels of CaSMP transcript accumulation in the yellow/green phenological stage. Moreover, CaSMP was preferentially expressed in the endosperm and was down-regulated during water imbibition of the seeds. The presence of regulatory cis-elements known to be involved in seed- and endosperm-specific expression was observed in the CaSMP 5′-upstream region amplified by genome walking (GW). Additional histochemical analysis of transgenic tomato (cv. Micro-Tom) lines harboring the GW-amplified fragment (~ 1.4 kb) fused to uidA reporter gene confirmed promoter activity in the ovule of immature tomato fruits, while no activity was observed in the seeds of ripening fruits and in the other organs/tissues examined. These results indicate that the CaSMP promoter can be used to drive transgene expression in coffee beans and tomato seeds, thus representing a promising biotechnological tool. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Seven treatments were tested: Chitosan at concentrations of 1%, 3%, and 5%; carnauba wax at concentrations of 0.5%, 1%, and 12%, and a control treatment, without coating application. Carrots were stored at 2 °C, 95–100% RH, for 30 days, and were evaluated on the day of application (day 0) and at 7, 15, and 30 days. Indices of brown stains, coloring, and light microscopy analysis were developed. The use of edible coatings for yellow carrots was not viable, regardless of the treatment used, and carnauba waxes caused more severe brown stains. Higher concentrations of carnauba wax caused damage of the carrot periderm, generating, in addition to the stains, deep depressions and superficial viscosity. Only the control treatment showed no degradation in appearance. Treatments with the highest index scores presented lower luminosity, lower b color values, and higher a color values, which showed that the brown stains impacted carrot appearance and, therefore, their visual quality. The results showed that coatings based on chitosan and carnauba wax are not recommended for yellow carrots, since they negatively affected appearance of the product, leaving them unmarketable. © 2018 by the authors.

For many years, diuron+hexazinone was one of the main herbicide mixture formulations used in sugarcane. Later, sulfometuron-methyl was included in the same mixture, which was marketed as a new herbicide formulation for residual in-season weed control in sugarcane. The mixture diuron+hexazinone+sulfometuron-methyl has been widely used in commercial sugarcane fields in Brazil. However, recent field observations have shown that sugarcane plants at different growth stages varied in their phytotoxicity levels after treatment with diuron+hexazinone+sulfometuron-methyl. Greenhouse and laboratory studies were conducted to determine                              14                             Csulfometuron-methyl absorption and translocation, as well as                              14                             C distribution in sugarcane at two growth stages, 2 to 3 leaves and 5 to 6 leaves.                              14                             Csulfometuron-methyl absorption by sugarcane did not differ between the two growth stages.

The maintenance of cyanobacterial strains in laboratory cultures is an important source of material for biological and chemical evaluation as well as biotechnological investigations. In this way, this work aimed to identify, for the first time, by means of GC–MS analyses, the nonpolar chemical profiles of four morphologically distinct cyanobacterial strains: Cyanobium sp. CENA178, Cyanobium sp. CENA181, Oxynema sp. CENA135 and Nostoc sp. CENA175, which were previously isolated from Brazilian mangroves. Six distinct classes of volatile compounds were identified: acids, alcohols, fatty aldehydes, esters, ketones and aliphatic hydrocarbons, from which 12 compounds were detected. The predominant compounds were 1-octadecyne and tetradecanoic acid, obtained from Oxynema sp. CENA135 and; the last one being also observed in Cyanobium sp. CENA181. In addition, the aliphatic hydrocarbon heptadecane was produced by these cyanobacterial strains as well as by Nostoc sp. CENA175. The compounds produced by the studied cyanobacteria have already been reported as possessing pharmaceutical properties such as antioxidant, cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities, besides industrial importance as source of intermediates for biofuel production. It is also important to mention that, considering the number of non-identified compounds, which were not compatible with the searched databases, these strains are promising sources of new compounds, denoting the need for more studies. Accordingly, since these strains were isolated from saline or brackish waters, it is also expected that they might be cultivated in waters not used for human consumption, enabling a low-cost approach for biomass and metabolites production. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Microplastics is a term used to group a range of different polymeric synthetic materials of size < 5 mm. These materials have been reported by several studies in different environmental matrices globally and present physical and chemical risk to organisms at the base of the food chain. However, in Brazil, interest in the subject is relatively new and few studies have been published in recent years. Here we present an overview of the plastic industry, microplastics as contaminants in the Anthropocene and review the literature on microplastic contamination in Brazilian environmental matrices with their respective methodologies. © 2018 Secretaria Regional do Rio de Janeiro da Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.All rights reserved.

In addition to uses mentioned above, the improper disposal of these substances may cause problems in the aquatic environments such as bioaccumulation, bioconcentration and biomagnification. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the bioconcentration and depuration of sulfadiazine using the teleost fish Danio rerio as test organism. During 20 days of exposal to 14C-sulfadiazine, a small amount of the antimicrobial concentration was observed on fish. Further, no depuration was noted during this period. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.	Article	Scopus

(Coleoptera: Scarabeidae) and Naupactus cervinus (Boh.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) are considered primary pests in citrus crops in Brazil, causing damage to plants and decreasing productivity. However, few studies investigate the ecology of these insects. In this context, the use of stable isotopes analysis (SIA) emerges as an alternative technique to conventional studies of behavioral ecology because it is faster and may explain feeding behavior based on the food source for each species. Field sampling and laboratory experiments were carried out to examine the changes of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (δ13C and δ15N) among pests and host plants (C3 citrus and C4 grasses), providing means to examine trophic interactions. Beetles were collected at the municipality of Gavião Peixoto, São Paulo State, identified and kept at 5 °C in saturated saline solution until the SIA. Two patterns for both species were found: δ13C value for N. cervinus was-23.6 ‰ and-13 ‰ for M. pumilio, indicating similarity between the results of δ13C of N. cervinus and citrus plants (-26 ‰) and dependence on grasses (-12 ‰) for M. pumilio individuals. The mean δ15N value was 4.3 and 5.8 ‰ for citrus plants and grass leaves, respectively, and the mean δ15N value was 4.4 ‰ for N. cervinus and 4.9 ‰ for M. pumilio. The results showed a higher affinity of N. cervinus for citrus roots since the larval stage compared with the alternative diet on M. pumilio. © 2018, Scientia Agricola. All rights reserved.

Treatments included three methods of N fertilizer (120 kg ha−1 N) application: 1) above the straw layer; 2) below the straw layer; 3) incorporated into the soil (at 0.1-m soil depth) below the straw layer; and 4) no N application (control). Sugarcane yield for the above straw treatment was, on average, 12% and 15% lower than below the straw and incorporated into the soil, respectively. Emissions of CH4 were very low and unaffected by N fertilizer placement. The method and timing of N application influenced N2O emissions. For both years, higher N2O emissions were observed from the above straw, followed by below straw and incorporated treatments. Except for the above straw treatment during the wet season, the N2O emission factors ranged from 0.08 to 0.62 and were lower than the IPCC default value (1%). The intensity of N2O emissions was, on average, 7.45, 3.97 and 3.3 kg CO2eq Mg stalk−1 for N applied above straw, below straw and incorporated into the soil, respectively. Changes in the N fertilizer placement method and on the timing of application can significantly reduce GHG emissions during sugarcane production, making a significant contribution toward a cleaner production of sugarcane ethanol. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

The effects of gamma radiation (at 0, 1, 2 and 3 kGy doses) on the free and bound total phenolics, antioxidant activity, and physicochemical and microbiological properties of black rice flour samples during storage were evaluated. The chemometric approach made it possible to observe the effects of irradiation and storage time on the samples. Regarding bioactive compounds, with the exception of the bound phenolic fractions the 3 kGy dose showed the highest values at time 0. At 120 days there was a decrease in these levels for all the samples, although the irradiated samples were most stable at the end of storage. Regarding the attribute of colour, the irradiation slightly modified all the parameters; in terms of microbiological analysis there was no growth of microorganisms at the end of storage. © 2019 North University of Baia Mare.

The lowest-income social class spends around 17% of their domestic budget on pet food and other items related to pets. Consumers are frequently misled by advertising as there is no precise information about the main sources of protein, carbohydrates and fat in the labels, and the Brazilian pet food industry can legally claim that their products contain certain items like salmon or beef even if they use just a flavoring compound. Methods: The stable isotope methodology compares the stable isotope ratios of carbon (13C/12C) and nitrogen (15N/14N) between source and product. The 13C/12C ratio of a specific product (e.g., dog food) reveals the proportions of C4 (maize) and C3 (soybean, rice and wheat) plants in that product and the 15N/14N ratio reveals the proportion of the compounds derived from animals. With this isotopic data, we used MixSIAR, a Bayesian stable isotope-mixing model, to estimate the proportion of maize, grains, poultry and beef in dog food. Results: The d13C values of dry dog food ranged from -24.2 to -12.8, with an average (± standard-deviation) of -17.1 ± 2.8. The d13C values of wet pet food ranged from -25.4 to -16.9, with an average (± standard-deviation) of -21.2 ± 2.4, which was significantly lower (p < 0.01). The d15N values of the dry and wet food ranged from 1.7 to 4.2, and from 0.5 to 5.5, respectively. The average d15N values of dry food (2.9 ± 0.5) was not higher than the wet food (2.6 ± 1.3) (p > 0.01). The output of the MixSIAR showed a low proportion of bovine products in dry dog food samples. On the other hand, poultry was obviously the dominant ingredient present in most of the samples. Maize was the second dominant ingredient. Wet and dry dog food showed similar isotopic analysis results. The only difference was a lower proportion of maize and higher proportion of grains in wet dog food. Discussion: The main finding is that dog food in Brazil is mostly made of approximately 60% (ranging from 32% to 86%) animal-based and 40% (ranging from 14% to 67%) plant-based products. Poultry and maize are the main ingredients. Poultry is added as a by-product or meal, which avoids competition between dogs and humans for meat products, while they can compete for maize. On the other hand, a large proportion of plant-based products in dog food decreases the energy and environmental footprint, since plant-based food products tend to be less harmful compared to animal-based products. Labels can mislead consumers by showing pictures of items that are not necessarily part of the product composition and by not showing the detailed information on the proportion of each ingredient. This information would allow customers to make their own choices considering their pet’s nutrition, the competition between animals and humans for resources and environmental sustainability. © 2019 Galera et al.

The extracts obtained from this plant are used to treat rhinitis, chest inflammation, bronchitis, dental caries, scabies, skin diseases, and infections in the digestive apparatus. Despite all its medicinal properties, there is a lack of studies that apply advanced chemical profiling techniques to characterize the chemical diversity of these extracts. The objective of this study was to apply a detailed multiplatform-based metabolite profiling approach to identify antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds in R. communis extracts. Leaf, stem and root extracts were obtained by maceration in hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol. Antioxidant activity was assessed by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay and total phenolic compounds were quantified by Folin-Ciocalteu method. Antimicrobial activity was assessed against Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonela choleraesuis, Candida albicans and C. glabrata. Nuclear magnetic resonance, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry were used to characterize the chemical profile of the extracts. The antioxidant activity (IC50) of the extracts ranged from 31.73 ± 2.59 to 571.74 ± 45.92 μg mL−1, whereas total phenolic content varied from 16.96 ± 0.30 to 135.06 ± 1.69 mg GAE/g of extract. Extracts obtained with ethanol showed the greatest antioxidant activity, the highest total phenolic content, along with the most promising antimicrobial properties. For example, the ethanolic extract of the leaves showed antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa, S. choleraesius, and C. albicans, whereas the ethanol extract of the roots showed antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. Three metabolites were annotated and quantified by NMR, 54 by LC–MS, and 36 by GC–MS, which included alkaloids, fatty acids, terpenes, phenolic compounds, steroids and carotenoid derivatives. The ethanol extract of the leaves showed high levels of the alkaloid ricinine, which seems to contribute for the activities of this extract. This approach allowed us to identify antioxidant and antimicrobial present in R. communis extracts. Therefore, providing important leads into the discovery of new active compounds and possibly to the development of new pharmaceuticals. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

The studied populations were collected from seven alkaline lakes of the Brazilian Pantanal and Nabor Carrillo Lake, Texcoco region (Mexico), between 2004 and 2012, where they frequently formed blooms during the dry season. The morphological plasticity of the populations, from natural and culture conditions, was described based on 200 individuals of each species. The 16S rRNA and the cpc-BA-IGS phylogenetic analyses show Anabaenopsis as a sister-taxon of Cyanospira. The Anabaenopsis clade has three strongly supported subclusters related to the origin of strains: Pantanal+Mexico, Kenya+Australia and one European clade. Although these data indicate that the currently known Anabaenopsis strains belong to more than one species, we are being conservative and not describing them as new species due to the lack of more molecular data. We highlight the need of a revision of the genus, considering also that Anabaenopsis sp. PCC 9215, the current reference strain used for the genus, is not identified as A. elenkinii and it is phylogenetically grouped with Anabaenopsis strains identified as A. circularis, A. arnoldii, A. nadsonii and A. elenkinii. © 2018 Magnolia Press.

However, whether and how the light and hormonal signaling cascades crosstalk to control this metabolic route remain poorly elucidated. Here, the potential involvement of ethylene and auxins in the light-mediated regulation of tomato fruit carotenogenesis was investigated by comparing the impacts of light treatments and the light-hyperresponsive high pigment-2 (hp2) mutation on both carotenoid synthesis and hormonal signaling. Under either light or dark conditions, the overaccumulation of carotenoids in hp2 ripening fruits was associated with disturbed ethylene production, increased expression of genes encoding master regulators of ripening and higher ethylene sensitivity and signaling output. The increased ethylene sensitivity observed in hp2 fruits was associated with the differential expression of genes encoding ethylene receptors and downstream signaling transduction elements, including the downregulation of the transcription factor ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR.E4, a repressor of carotenoid synthesis. Accordingly, treatments with exogenous ethylene promoted carotenoid biosynthetic genes more intensively in hp2 than in wild-type fruits. Moreover, the loss of HP2 function drastically altered auxin signaling in tomato fruits, resulting in higher activation of the auxin-responsive promoter DR5, severe down-regulation of AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) genes and altered accumulation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcripts. Both tomato ARF2 paralogues (Sl-ARF2a and SlARF2b) were up-regulated in hp2 fruits, which agrees with the promotive roles played by these ARFs in tomato fruit ripening and carotenoid biosynthesis. Among the genes differentially expressed in hp2 fruits, the additive effect of light treatment and loss of HP2 function was particularly evident for those encoding carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes, ethylene-related transcription factors, Aux/IAAs and ARFs. Altogether, the data uncover the involvement of ethylene and auxin as part of the light signaling cascades controlling tomato fruit metabolism and provide a new link between light signaling, plant hormone sensitivity and carotenoid metabolism in ripening fruits. © 2018 Cruz, Bianchetti, Alves, Purgatto, Peres, Rossi and Freschi.

Therefore, a better understanding of the effects of elevated CO2 on forage quality can elucidate the interaction between forage and livestock production and possible adaptations for a climate change scenario. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of contrasting atmospheric CO2 concentrations on biomass production, morphological characteristics, fiber fractions, and elemental composition of Brachiaria decumbens (cv. Basilisk). Methods: A total of 12 octagonal rings with 10 m diameter were distributed in a seven-ha coffee plantation and inside each of them, two plots of 0.25 m2 were seeded with B. decumbens (cv. Basilisk) in a free air carbon dioxide enrichment facility. Six rings were kept under natural conditions (≈390 mmol mol-1 CO2; Control) and other six under pure CO2 flux to achieve a higher concentration (≈550 mmol mol-1 CO2; Elevated CO2). After 30 months under contrasting atmospheric CO2 concentration, grass samples were collected, and then splitted into two portions: in the first, whole forage was kept intact and in the second portion, the leaf, true stem, inflorescence and senescence fractions were manually separated to determine their proportions (%). All samples were then analyzed to determine the fiber fractions (NDF, hemicellulose, ADF, cellulose, and Lignin), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) contents and N isotopic composition. Results: Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration did not influence biomass productivity, average height, leaf, stem, senescence and inflorescence proportions, and fiber fractions (p > 0.05). Calcium content of the leaf and senescence portion of B. decumbens were reduced under elevated atmospheric CO2 (p < 0.05). Despite no effect on total C and N (p > 0.05), lower C:N ratio was observed in the whole forage grown under elevated CO2 (p < 0.05). The isotopic composition was also affected by elevated CO2, with higher values of d15N in the leaf and stem portions of B. decumbens (p < 0.05). Discussion: Productivity and fiber fractions of B. decumbens were not influenced by CO2 enrichment. However, elevated CO2 resulted in decreased forage Ca content which could affect livestock production under a climate change scenario. © 2019 Abdalla Filho et al.	Article	Scopus

Due to its high perishability, postharvest studies aimed at increasing its shelf life are required. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of harvesting time on the conservation of the physicochemical characteristics and antioxidant compounds of camu-camu during cold storage. The fruits, harvested at different ripening stages (red and reddish-green peel), were stored in polyethylene terephthalate trays at 15 °C and 90% relative humidity. The following analyses were carried out on days 1, 2, 5, 7, 9 and 13 after harvest: luminosity, hue angle and chromaticity, pH, soluble solids content, titratable acidity, SS/TA, ascorbic acid content, total phenolic content, total anthocyanin content and free-radical-scavenging activity by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazil method. The data were submitted to a multivariate analysis. The fruits harvested at different ripening stages showed different postharvest characteristics, highlighting the parameters of colour, flavour and antioxidants. The reddish-green fruits, despite their low concentration of anthocyanins during storage, showed high levels of phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid and antioxidant activity, which were maintained for nine days of cold storage. Due to the flavour characteristics and antioxidant compounds, it is recommended that camu-camu be harvested in the reddish-green maturation stage to extend its shelf life. © 2019 Instituto de Tecnologia de Alimentos - ITAL.

Kaolinite crystallinity indices were evaluated in the context of pedogenetic processes associated with a representative Amazonian Ferralsol-Podzol soil system. This soil system, which is comprised of various types of kaolinitic materials and has a soil dynamics characterized by the progressive replacement of Ferralsols by Podzols, has been evaluated by Hinckley (HI), Aparicio-Galán-Ferrell (AGFI), Liètard (R2), and Amigó (A001) “crystallinity indices” and the “expert system” of Plançon and Zacharie (PZ). The results indicate that the complexity of the kaolinite population, which is due to pedogenetic processes, makes it difficult to interpret the usual kaolinite crystallinity indices. In areas where kaolinites are formed under low aggressive conditions (higher pH and lower dissolved organic carbon, DOC) and in equilibrium with the soil solutions, low-defect phase becomes dominant and there is a good consistency between the “crystallinities” provided by each index. However, in areas where kaolinites are formed under highly aggressive conditions (lower pH and higher DOC), the proportion of low-defect phase decreases. This induces changes in the values of the indices, which do not have the same weight from one index to another. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

The northern Brazilian coast has one of the largest continuous mangrove areas on Earth, with the mangroves from the Bragança Peninsula, in eastern Amazonia, being the most representative ones. These mangroves have migrated into higher tidal flats over recent years. We analyzed spatial–temporal changes of vegetation units adapted to different physical–chemical conditions along the Bragança Peninsula in order to decipher possible causes responsible for such recent mangrove dynamics. The investigation was based on time series analysis of a 33-year (1984–2017) database consisting of satellite and drone images. These data were combined with digital elevation models based on topographical data obtained by photogrammetry, theodolite and hydrotopographic devices. During this time frame, mangroves invaded 2.7 km2 of inner tidal flats, which is compatible with a rise in relative sea level (RSL) and with a rainfall decreasing. Such topography-dependent dynamic suggests that an increased frequency of tidal inundation decreased porewater salinity and caused mangroves to expand into topographically higher grounds. However, the study area contains small basins, that are less affected by tidal inundation, and Avicennia trees are dying in these locations due to increased porewater salinity, probably caused by a decreased rainfall. We propose that climate and RSL are responsible for driving the death of mangroves in the study area, and their migration into the topographically highest tidal flats. Assuming a RSL rise of 5 mm/yr under stable rainfall, or a RSL rise of 3 mm/yr accompanied by decreased rainfall, it is projected that mangrove areas will expand by 2.93 or 1.35 km2, respectively, by the end of this century. The combination of photogrammetry with theodolite/hydrotopographic surveying proved to be an efficient and innovative process for monitoring and evaluating the impacts of global changes on mangroves. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Biological control of pathogens by endophytes may be used to decrease fungicide application rates and environmental impacts. Previously, Diaporthe sp. B46-64 and C27-07 were highlighted as antagonists of grapevine phytopathogens. Herein, molecular multigene (ITS-TUB-TEF1) identification and phylogenetic analysis allowed the identification of these endophytes as belonging to Diaporthe schini species. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation was employed for obtaining 14 stable and traceable gfp- or DsRed-expressing transformants, with high transformation efficiency: 96% for the pFAT-GFP plasmid and 98% for pCAM-DsRed plasmid. Transformants were resistant to hygromycin B with gene hph confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and proved to be mitotically stable, expressing the fluorescent phenotype, with morphological differences in the colonies when compared with wild strains. In vitro antagonism tests revealed an increased antagonistic activity of some transformant strains. The current genetic transformation of D. schini mediated by A. tumefaciens proved to be an efficient technique within the randomized insertion of reporter genes for the monitoring of the strain in the environment. © 2019, Association of Microbiologists of India.

Due to climatic changes, the interaction between light and temperature is studied in aquatic systems, but no study has addressed the effect of both variables on the saxitoxins production. This study evaluated the combined effect of light and temperature on saxitoxins production and cellular quota in C. raciborskii. Experiments were performed with three C. raciborskii strains in batch cultures under six light intensities (10, 40, 60, 100, 150, and 500 µmol of photons m                             -2                              s                             -1                             ) and four temperatures (15, 20, 25, and 30 °C). The growth of C. raciborskii strains was limited at lower temperatures and the maximum growth rates were obtained under higher light combined with temperatures equal or above 20 °C, depending on the strain. In general, growth was highest at 30 °C at the lower light intensities and equally high at 25 °C and 30 °C under higher light. Highest saxitoxins concentration and cell-quota occurred at 25 °C under high light intensities, but were much lower at 30 °C. Hence, increased temperatures combined with sufficient light will lead to higher C. raciborskii biomass, but blooms could become less toxic in tropical regions.                          © 2019 by the authors.

In this study, the feasibility of using a stable isotope marking technique for the South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann), was assessed. Wild flies were collected from apple orchards, which are a target of a SIT project in southern Brazil. To verify if adult flies could be labelled by the stable isotopes from larval diets, larvae were reared on two different C                             4                             -based diets and fruits in laboratory. To evaluate the influence of the two most common attractants applied to capture A. fraterculus (grape juice and CeraTrap                             TM                             ) and the most common preservation method in fruit fly collections (ethanol), laboratory-reared flies were immersed in McPhail traps containing the respective treatments for two periods of time. Samples were analyzed in an elemental analyzer coupled to a Continuous Flow Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (CF-IRMS) at CENA/USP. The δ                             13                             C signatures of flies reared on artificial diets differed significantly from the δ                             13                             C of flies whose larvae were reared on fruits and from wild flies. In contrast, the δ                             15                             N values were less conclusive and the technique could not rely solely on them. In all cases considered, the δ                             13                             C and δ                             15                             N signatures from males did not differ from females. Despite the alterations caused by the attractants tested and ethanol, laboratory-flies could be distinguished from the wild ones based on δ                             13                             C signatures. This is the first comprehensive study to demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish wild A. fraterculus from flies reared on larval diets containing C                             4                              sugar. The first experimentally derived trophic discrimination factors were also obtained for this species. Thus, intrinsic isotope labelling can serve as a backup to conventional dye marking.                          © 2018 Botteon et al.

As a result, beneficial traits of wild species, such as disease resistance and stress tolerance, have been lost2. We devised a CRISPR–Cas9 genome engineering strategy to combine agronomically desirable traits with useful traits present in wild lines. We report that editing of six loci that are important for yield and productivity in present-day tomato crop lines enabled de novo domestication of wild Solanum pimpinellifolium. Engineered S. pimpinellifolium morphology was altered, together with the size, number and nutritional value of the fruits. Compared with the wild parent, our engineered lines have a threefold increase in fruit size and a tenfold increase in fruit number. Notably, fruit lycopene accumulation is improved by 500% compared with the widely cultivated S. lycopersicum. Our results pave the way for molecular breeding programs to exploit the genetic diversity present in wild plants. © 2018, Nature Publishing Group. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

This study was conducted in southern Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in January 2014, at two farms that incorporated integrated crop-livestock systems in Hapludox soil. Impacts of management were assessed through evaluation of functional bacterial communities using quantitative PCR (qPCR) of nitrogen cycling genes (amoA, nirK, and nosZ), PCR-DGGE of the nirK community composition, and by investigating relationships of the nirK community with soil properties. The nirK gene community showed that reference forest soil maintained relatively large nirK, nosZ, but small amoA gene abundances and large range weighted nirK richness (Rr). The introduction of pasture into crop-livestock integration management (inclusion of the second and third year of grazing within a crop-livestock integration system, CL-2 and CL-3, respectively) or the field in its first year of crop rotation after grazing pasture (CL-b) increased nosZ and amoA abundance. Three years of grazing pasture in crop-livestock integration (CL-a) increased nirK abundance, while multiple years of crop rotation in crop-livestock integration management systems increased soil OM and promoted a richer nirK community composition. The nirK community Rr that was not significantly different from the forest was observed in the second or third year of crop rotation after grazing (CL-c or CL-d, respectively) and (CL-3). In contrast, fields in pasture (CL-a, continuous pasture (CP)) and the first year of crop rotation after pasture (CL-b) had reduced Rr and functional organization curves, indicating communities less resilient to future stress. Management systems under integrated crop-livestock farming in tropical soil maintained a relatively diverse N cycling bacterial community, possibly promoting soil quality and N cycling processes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty Santa Inês lambs (10 castrated males and 10 females) with 18.0 ± 3.50 kg initial bodyweight (BW) and 3 months of age were maintained in individual stalls in a completely randomised design. They were divided into two groups with five males and five females each (Bt 2036 group (n = 10) and control group (n = 10)). The animals of the Bt 2036 group received daily 2.5 × 106 spores of Bt 2036/kg BW and control animals received a placebo. The diet consisted of Tifton-85 (Cynodon spp.) hay ad libitum and 300 g/animal.day of concentrate mixture, which was adjusted according to growth requirements. During 53 days, animal performance was evaluated, with feed intake measured three times per week and lambs weighed fortnightly. Blood samples were taken every 15 days to evaluate hematological and biochemical parameters. Rumen fermentation was investigated in three stages (start, middle and end of the experimental period) using parameters such as pH, ammoniacal nitrogen, short chain fatty acids, and populations of Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, anaerobic fungi, methanogenic archaea and protozoa. At the end of the performance experiment, 18 lambs (Bt 2036 (n = 9), control (n = 9)) were selected for a digestibility trial, and placed in metabolic cages to estimate apparent nutrient digestibility, nitrogen balance and microbial protein synthesis. Ten male (Bt 2036 (n = 5), control (n = 5)) lambs were used to evaluate CH4 production using the hexafluoride tracer technique. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of Bt 2036 on any of the evaluated parameters. The daily addition of 2.5 × 106 spores/kg BW of Bt 2036 in the ruminant diet did not cause any negative effects on hematological traits or animal poisoning, nor did it interfere with fermentation by rumen microorganisms, apparent digestibility of nutrients or animal performance. © 2019 CSIRO.

However, concerns arise from nitrogen (N) uptake by the intercropping crop causing reduction in the yield of the corn. Our objective was to evaluate N recovery efficiency (NRE), and the N dynamics in the soil-plant system in corn intercropped with palisade grass. A field trial was carried out in Bahia, Brazil, evaluating two cropping systems: corn (monoculture) and corn intercropped with palisade grass sowed between rows on the same day as the corn crop, with four replicates in a completely randomized block design. Nitrogen (150 kg∙ha–1 of15 N-urea) was applied at sowing to determine NRE, which means the amounts of N-fertilizer uptake in corn and palisade grass, the amounts of N-fertilizer in soil and the15N-fertilizer balance. Neither the NRE (63.3% in monoculture and 57.2% in intercropping) nor corn grain yield (9,800 kg∙ha–1 in monoculture and 9,671 kg∙ha–1 in intercropping) was affected by intercropping, which accumulated only 2.1 kg∙ha–1 of N-fertilizer or 1.4% N rate. In addition, palisade grass yielded 2,265 kg∙ha–1 of dry matter. The balance indicated that 82.4% of N-fertilizer was recovered in the monoculture and 86.9% in the intercropping. Intercropping palisade grass does not affect grain yield or N corn nutrition and has the potential to increase straw production contributing to maintenance of no-till. © 2018, Agronomic Institute of Campinas.

Commercial cellulolytic enzymes (HPL, CL, P1 and P4) were used for enzymatic hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse and the amount of total released sugars was quantified. Total cellulolytic activity and the required enzyme concentration were determined. Then, the enzymes were tested with regard to their efficiency in pretreating sugarcane bagasse in acidic and alkaline solutions, followed by a steam autoclave treatment. Upon total sugars quantification, it was possible to conclude that the most efficient bagasse treatment was an acidic pretreatment procedure with commercial enzyme P4. © 2018 Editura Academiei Romane.

This study reports the first physiological, nutritional, and ultrastructural description of Se toxicity in cowpea growing under field conditions. Selenium was supplied as a foliar application of sodium selenite at varying concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1200, and 1600 g ha−1). An increased yield was observed with the application of 50 g ha−1 Se. Application of concentrations higher than 50 g ha−1 caused leaf toxicity. Increased lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide concentration and reduced total sugars, sucrose, and carotenoid concentration were observed at highest doses tested (1200 and 1600 g ha−1). Applications of more than 50 g ha−1 Se reduced the phloem diameter, caused chlorosis of the leaf blade with a coalescence of lesions, and caused pink salt deposits to appear. Lesions were observed mainly near the trichomes on the adaxial surface of the leaf blade. An analysis of the element distribution with microprobe X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (μ-XRF) revealed accumulation of Se, calcium (Ca), potassium (K), copper (Cu), and manganese (Mn) near the primary vein and in the necrotic brown areas of the leaf lesions. In contrast, Na was homogeneously distributed in the leaf tissue. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

Models that explicitly take into account root water uptake and transpiration reduction describe the ability of soil to supply water to plants based on soil hydraulic properties that depend on soil water content. The objective of this study was to further develop an existing single-layer root water uptake model based on matric flux potential to allow for multi-layer scenarios; and to illustrate its functionality using soil hydraulic properties from layered soils from two climate zones in Brazil: a semiarid zone and a humid zone. For each soil layer, the hydraulic properties were determined by inverse modeling of laboratory evaporation experiment data available for pressure heads between −165 and −1.5 m. The water supplying capacities of soils were evaluated using the newly developed multi-layer root water uptake model. Soils from the semiarid zone were able to supply water to plants over a wider range of pressure heads. Soils from the humid zone showed slightly stronger hydraulic restrictions for supplying transpirable water. For the analyzed soils, only a negligible increase in available water results from decreasing the root water potential below −150 m. Therefore, based on this analysis, it is reasonable to expect plant adaptation to move toward an increase of root length density rather than to a decrease of minimum root water potential. © Soil Science Society of America.

In this work, we demonstrate the potential of roasted jackfruit seeds to substitute for cocoa powder in cappuccino formulations. Two different flours were produced from a hard variety jackfruit by drying or fermenting the seeds prior to roasting. Next, formulations were prepared with 50%, 75%, and 100% substitution of cocoa powder with jackfruit seed flours, totalizing seven with control formulation. The acceptance of cappuccinos by consumers (n = 126) and quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA®) were used to describe the preparations. Physicochemical properties were also evaluated. When 50% and 75% cocoa powder was replaced with dry jackfruit seed flour, there was no change in sensory acceptability or technological properties; however, it is possible to identify advantages tousing dry jackfruit seed flour, including moisture reduction and high wettability, solubility and sensory acceptation of the chocolate aroma. The principal component analysis of QDA explained90% variances; cluster analysis enabled the definition of four groups for six cappuccino preparations. In fact, dry jackfruit seed flour is an innovative cocoa powder substitute; it could be used in food preparations, consequently utilizing this tropical fruit waste by incorporating it as an ingredient in a common product of the human diet.

Slaughter occurred after fasting and electroshock, followed by dissection of the jugular veins and carotid arteries. Hot carcass weight, hot carcass yield, carcass length, skin thickness, shoulder, neck, loin, belly, rib and leg weights and percentages, leg length, and girth were measured. The rib eye area, color (by CIELAB system), shear force, and cooking loss were also measured. The data were analyzed using SAS procedures for analysis of variance, regressions, correlations, and principal components. Hot carcass weight was 15.75 kg and yield was 43.65%. Younger animals had higher leg yield while yields of loin and shoulder increased as age increased. The meat was darker in older animals. As age increased, both the quantity of commercial cuts decreased and the loss of quality traits, such as color, cooking loss, and shear force, increased; therefore, slaughter should be performed before 30 months of age. © 2018 Universidade Federal de Goias.

Here we evaluate genotypic differences in Al tolerance in four Urochloa (U. decumbens cultivar Basilisk; U. brizantha cultivar Marandu; U. brizantha cultivar Piatã and U. brizantha cultivar Xaraés) cultivated in nutrient solution, during growth and regrowth. We analyzed the effect of Al uptake on epidermal and cell membrane damage, and lipid peroxidation in shoots and roots. Exposure of genotypes to Al concentration up to 1.33 mmol L−1 led to different degrees of shoot yield, mainly during the growth period. Increased Al concentration decreased dry matter production in shoots and roots, reduced leaf area (LA), relative root growth, increased Al accumulation in the roots and root-to-shoot Al translocation, notably during the first growth period. However, Al translocation from roots to shoots augmented massively in all genotypes, during the regrowth. Plant roots exposed to Al were damaged, exhibiting ruptures in the epidermis and reduced number of root hairs. Lipid peroxidation in shoots ranged in all genotypes exposed to Al, however, the oxidative stress was 2–5 times higher in shoots than in roots, notably in Marandu that accumulated 95% more Al than U. decumbens. This suggests that in the genotypes that are more tolerant to Al there is maintenance of metabolic activities, including upregulated and efficient antioxidant activity, root growth, LA growth and biomass yield. © 2018, Brazilian Society of Plant Physiology.

Fixed values for bmin are commonly used in crop growth and hydrological models, thus relegating the physical process of gas flow. We developed a process-based approach to estimate the minimum air-filled porosity along the soil profile, assuming the excess of CO2 to trigger the onset of deficit aeration. The developed set of equations is based on Fick’s law and mass conservation and includes root depth and pore-space tortuosity for gas diffusivity, rate of gas production over depth and soil gaseous diffusivity. The developed theory allows prediction of gas concentrations and aeration status for different boundary conditions. The minimum air-filled porosity was shown to be dependent on profile depth and soil type, and in this respect commonly used fixed values for entire soil profiles would be flawed. When considering the pressure heads corresponding to these minimum air-filled porosity, results showed an even higher dependence of soil type. © Soil Science Society of America.	Article	Scopus

Eighteen castrated male Saanen goats (25 ± 2.3 kg body weight (BW)) received a basal diet (ground ear maize, ground maize and vitamin-mineral premix). The treatments consisted of adding limestone to the basal diet to provide Ca content of 0.6, 1.7 and 3.0 g/kg dry matter (DM). The experiment lasted 45 days (i.e. 36 d of adaptation and 9 days of measurements). On day 38, 0.5 ml of 7.4 MBq                              45                             Ca solution was administrated before feeding. From days 39 to 45, samples of faeces, blood and urine were collected, and Ca concentration determined. The Ca intake, Ca in faeces, Ca in urine, faecal endogenous Ca and true absorbed Ca increased linearly as Ca content in the diets increased, while retained Ca increased at a decreasing rate. Dry matter intake decreased at an increasing rate with increased Ca content in the diets. In contrast, Ca content in the diets did not affect biological availability of Ca, or Ca in plasma. The true biological availability of Ca from limestone in Saanen goats was 0.72. The daily NCam was 11.6 (±1.3) mg/kg BW. The current results might help to understand Ca dynamics in goats and enhance the formulation of balanced diets to best meet Ca requirements of Saanen goats.                          © 2018 Cambridge University Press.

This study investigated the performance, carcass and meat characteristics of lambs from the Morada Nova and Santa Inês locally adapted hair breeds and crosses between Dorper × Morada Nova and Dorper × Santa Inês slaughtered at approximately 35 kg. Morada Nova lambs showed lower (p < 0.05) performance compared to the other genetic groups resulting in a higher age at slaughter (p < 0.05). Crossbred Dorper × Santa Inês and Dorper × Morada Nova lambs showed better characteristics for meat production with better (p < 0.05) conformation as well as leg and carcass compacteness index. Dorper × Santa Inês have a fatty acid profile that is more suitable for human consumption than Dorper × Morada Nova lambs do (p < 0.05); however, both had lower (p < 0.05) intramuscular lipid content (as measured by ether extract levels from Longíssimus lumborum) compared with purebred lambs. Therefore, when the objective is to obtain lean meat, with improved nutritional profile to reduce risks of cardiovascular disease, the use of breeds and crosses that reduce animal slaughter age, such as the ½ Dorper × ½ Santa Inês crossbred, is an interesting alternative. © 2018, Scientia Agricola.

Thus, the aim of this research was to evaluate the fate of diuron, hexazinone, and metribuzin in five soils (Clay-1, Clay-2, Loam-1, Loam-2, and Sand), presenting variation in clay content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, and organic carbon (OC). Herbicides radiolabeled with 14C were applied, and the 14C–CO2 released from mineralization was trapped in 0.2 mol L−1 sodium hydroxide solution. The degradation ratio, as well as herbicide-bound residues (non-extractable), transformation products, and residues extractable from soil, was also evaluated. Average 14C–CO2 evolution accumulated for diuron mineralization was higher (22.24%) than hexazinone (7.73%) and metribuzin (3.20%). The degradation time half-life (DT50) values for hexazinone correlated with soil OC content. Although no correlation between soil properties and DT50 values was found for metribuzin, the degradation rate and total degree of mineralization were low in sand soil for metribuzin. Regarding diuron, OC content and CEC value appear to be related to mineralization and degradation rate, respectively. Differences in soil properties can influence the persistence and fate of herbicides, affecting their impact on the environment, weed control, and possible effects on subsequent crops. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Among these constraints, drought stress has become the main limiting factor to crop production around the world. Water deprivation is perceived primarily by the roots, which efficiently signal the shoot to trigger drought responses in order to maximize a plant's ability to survive. In this study, the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) mutant procera (pro), with a constitutive response to gibberellin (GA), and its near isogenic line cv. Micro-Tom (MT), were used in reciprocal grafting under well-watered and water stress conditions to evaluate the role of GA signaling in root-to-shoot communication during drought stress. Growth, oxidative stress, gene expression, water relations and hormonal content were measured in order to provide insights into GA-mediated adjustments to water stress. All graft combinations with pro (i.e. pro/pro, MT/pro and pro/MT) prevented the reduction of growth under stress conditions without a reduction in oxidative stress. The increase of oxidative stress was followed by upregulation of SlDREB2, a drought-tolerance related gene, in all drought-stressed plants. Scions harboring the pro mutation tended to increase the abscisic acid (ABA) content, independent of the rootstock. Moreover, the GA sensitivity of the rootstock modulated stomatal conductance and water use efficiency under drought stress, indicating GA and ABA crosstalk in the adjustment of growth and water economy. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH	Article	Scopus

Moreover, some research has focused on the reuse of P due to concerns about the end of its natural reserves. Biochar appears to be a solution to both problems and may act as a recovery of eutrophic/residual water with the subsequent reuse of P in agriculture, the purpose of which is to test such an assertion. Samples of biochar from poultry manure (BPM) and sugarcane straw (BCS) had their maximum adsorption capacities of Al obtained by Langmuir isotherm. These values were used to conduct the so-called post-doping process, conferring P adsorption capacity to the pyrolysed materials. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were adjusted for the same biochar types (Al-doped) at increasing P concentrations, in order to obtain their maximum P adsorption capacities (MPAC) and their parameters. The desorption of the adsorbed P in its MPAC was tested by three extractors: H2SO4, NaHCO3, and H2O. Finally, these biochars were used in competitive adsorption assays of phosphate, sulfate, chloride and nitrate anions and applied in a synthetic eutrophic water. The high values of MPAC of the powder materials (701.65 and 758.96 mg g−1 of P for BPM and BCS, respectively) are reduced by almost half for the fragment materials (356.04 and 468.84 mg g−1 of P for BPM and BCS, respectively), these values being almost entirely extracted the extractors. Its application in eutrophic/residual water, in addition to presenting a good MPAC, these materials adsorbed, in equal proportions, phosphates and sulfates, as well as to a lesser extent, nitrates and chlorides. Thus, biochar from poultry manure and sugarcane straw, after post-doping with Al, have high MPAC, being excellent materials for the recovery of waters and subsequent reuse in agriculture. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates the effect of bare and polyethylene glycol-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the germination and seedling development of Phaseolus vulgaris L. Although the germination rate was not affected by the treatments (1 to 1 000 mg Fe L-1), seed soaking in Fe3O4-PEG at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 increased radicle elongation (8.1 ± 1.1 cm vs 5.9 ± 1.0 cm for the control). Conversely, Fe2+/Fe3+(aq) and bare Fe3O4 at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 prevented the growth. X-ray spectroscopy and tomography showed that Fe penetrated in the seed. Enzymatic assays showed that Fe3O4-PEG was the least harmful treatment to α-amylase. The growth promoted by the Fe3O4-PEG might be related to water uptake enhancement induced by the PEG coating. These results show the potential of using coated iron nanoparticles to enhance the growth of common food crops. © 2018 American Chemical Society.	Article	Scopus

It is an ortholog of TERMINAL FLOWER1, a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein with antiflorigenic activity in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). A spontaneous loss-of-function mutation (sp) has been bred into several industrial tomato cultivars, as it produces a suite of pleiotropic effects that are favorable for mechanical harvesting, including determinate growth habit, short plant stature, and simultaneous fruit ripening. However, the physiological basis for these phenotypic differences has not been thoroughly explained. Here, we show that the sp mutation alters polar auxin transport as well as auxin responses, such as gravitropic curvature and elongation of excised hypocotyl segments. We also demonstrate that free auxin levels and auxin-regulated gene expression patterns are altered in sp mutants. Furthermore, diageotropica, a mutation in a gene encoding a cyclophilin A protein, appears to confer epistatic effects with sp. Our results indicate that SP affects the tomato growth habit at least in part by influencing auxin transport and responsiveness. These findings suggest potential novel targets that could be manipulated for controlling plant growth habit and improving productivity. © 2018 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The present work describes a novel procedure for determination of iodine value based on the discoloration of a triiodide aqueous solution due to halogenation of the unsaturated compounds in the samples. Iodine is extracted to the organic phase and consumed proportionally to the amount of unsaturated compounds in the samples. Thus, the remaining fraction of I3-quantified by spectrophotometry in the aqueous phase is inversely proportional to the concentration of unsaturated compounds. For biodiesel samples, responses were linear from 10 to 106 g I2 per 100 g, with coefficient of variation and limit of detection estimated at 5.0% (n = 8) and 2.5 g I2 per 100 g, respectively. The corresponding values for vegetable oils were 20 to 140 g I2 per 100 g, 3.0% (n = 10), and 7 g I2 per 100 g, respectively. The procedure consumed only 1.2 mL of sample, 365 μg of I2, and 42 mg of KI with ca. 2.4 mL of waste generated per determination. The results agreed with those obtained by the official methods at the 95% confidence level. Printed in Brazil- © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.	Article	Scopus

An extensive range of scientific and environmental applications depend on the availability of fine spatial resolution temperature data. All satellite-based sensor systems that are equipped with a TIR detector depict a spatial resolution that is coarser than most of the multispectral bands of the same system. Certain studies may therefore be not feasible if applied in areas that depict a high spatial variation in temperature at small spatial scales, such as urban centers and flooded pristine areas. To solve this problem, this study applied an image downscaling method to enhance the spatial resolution of LST data by combining TIR, multispectral images, and derived data, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), according to the geographically weighted regression (GWRK) and area-to-point kriging of regressed residuals. The resulting LST images of the natural and anthropogenic urban areas of the Brazilian Pantanal are very highly correlated to the reference LST images. The approach, combining ASTER TIR with ASTER visible/infrared (VNIR) and Sentinel-2 images according to the GWRK method, performed better than all of the remaining state-of-the-art downscaling methods. © 2018 by the authors.

Sphaerocavum is a morphogenus distinguishable from Microcystis, as it presents hollow colonies and two-plane cell division. However, Sphaerocavum phylogenetic position based on marker gene(s) has not yet been established. Here, we combined morphological and molecular analyses to address the taxonomic and phylogenetic placement of Sphaerocavum isolated from Brazilian eutrophic lakes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Sphaerocavum and Microcystis clustered together in a well-established clade, thus not supporting the Sphaerocavum designation as a divergent genus. The type strain and isolated lineages from Brazilian tropical regions were grouped in the ITS phylogenetic analysis apart from other Microcystis strains. As such, although the infrageneric recognition of Microcystis by molecular markers is still unclear, our analyses strongly indicate that Sphaerocavum must be considered as a morphotype of Microcystis. Thus, taking together our morphological and molecular analyses, we propose the inclusion of Sphaerocavum within the genus Microcystis. In addition, we suggest that the strains used in this study should be named as Microcystis brasiliensis (Azevedo & Sant’Anna) Rigonato et al. comb. nov., with CCIBt3094 as the type strain. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

However, some herbicides have physico-chemical characteristics to pass through the straw in water solution. The aim was to evaluate the influence of different densities of sugarcane straw on the leaching of aminocyclopyrachlor in a tropical soil (Oxisol—Typic Hapludox) in a system of green cane harvesting. The experiment was carried out using glass columns filled with soil, with and without sugarcane straw (0, 5, 10, and 20 t ha−1) on the top of the soil. 14C-aminocyclopyrachlor was applied followed by 200 mm of simulated rain for 48 h. The herbicide was detected in all soil layers (0–30 cm), and in the leachate (> 30 cm), in small trace amounts (≤ 0.21%) in all treatments, showing that aminocyclopyrachlor undergoes a high degree of leaching in the clayey soil. In the absence of straw, 39% of the herbicide remained in the upper layer (0–5 cm). In the presence of straw, the herbicide was distributed through the soil profile, mainly from 0 to 25 cm. Forty percent more herbicide was retained in the straw with 20 t ha−1 of sugarcane straw. Thus, it is concluded that the straw in high amounts retains aminocyclopyrachlor, but does not prevent it from reaching the soil; the high solubility of the herbicide and intense rainfall in a short period of time are factors that contribute to the herbicide passing through this barrier. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

Principal players in this biodiversity are arthropods that help to decompose litterfall, favoring the recycling of nutrients and, hence, are an important part in sustaining the forest fragments that remain in urban areas. Therefore, it is important to study arthropod biodiversity in green urban areas, especially those areas where litterfall management is an important part of maintaining biodiversity. Accordingly, this study evaluated arthropod diversity associated with litterfall in three urban forests with different size and litterfall management practices, including água Branca Park (ABP) and Tietê Ecological Park (TEP)-Núcleo Engenheiro Goulart in São Paulo City and Chico Mendes Park (CMP) in Osasco City, all belonging to the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo (MRSP), Brazil. Four litterfall harvests were carried out in each park between April and August of 2015 with twelve samples collected with a wood mold (30-cmx30-cm) at randomly points on the forest floor. The collected material was then screened in the laboratory and the arthropods were visually separated and preserved in alcohol 70%. Arthropods were classified by the order to which they belonged. Litterfall was dried in a forced air oven at 65 °C for seven days. Dried litterfall was then separated into leaves, branches, reproductive parts and miscellaneous fragments and weighed. Arthropod diversity was measured by Shannon, Margalef and Pielou indexes and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) using the Manhattan distance index. Litterfall weight was compared by one-way ANOVA. The orders Hymenoptera, Collembola and Isopoda were dominant in CMP, ABP and TEP, respectively but multiple rare orders had a presence in all parks, albeit at different abundance. NMDS showed abundance similarity among the parks; however, TEP showed greater richness, Shannon diversity and evenness. The fractions of leaf litterfall and reproductive parts were different between the CMP and TEP. Overall, our results confirm that neither litterfall management, nor park size, is a final determinant of arthropod distribution, even though the abundance of dominant species was shown to differ in each park. © 2018 by the authors.

A shoot-root scale approach study under controlled conditions	2018	Agriculture (Switzerland)	8	11	180				10.3390/agriculture8110180	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057312629&doi=10.3390%2fagriculture8110180&partnerID=40&md5=67be263bc1341eb170750ecbbfa46a87	Potassium (K) is generally considered as being closely linked to plant water dynamics. Consequently, reinforcing K nutrition, which theoretically favors root growth and specific surface, extends leaf lifespan, and regulates stomatal functioning, is often used to tackle water stress. We designed a greenhouse pot-scale device to test these interactions on corn (Zea mays L.), and to analyze their links to plant transpiration. Three levels of K nutrition were combined with two water-supply treatments. Shoot and root development and growth were continuously measured during a 60-day-long experiment. Individual plant transpiration was measured by weighing pots and by calculating water mass balances. The results showed that, although K deficiency symptoms resembled those caused by water shortage, there was no advantage to over-fertilizing water-stressed plants. K failed to decrease either the transpiration per unit leaf surface or to improve water use efficiency. The link between K nutrition and plant transpiration appears solely attributable to the effect of K on leaf area. We conclude that K over-fertilization could ultimately jeopardize crops by enhancing early-stage water transpiration to the detriment of later developmental stages. © 2018 by the authors.

Endophytes have characteristics that are important for the health of the plant and have been isolated from several plants of economic and medicinal interest but rarely from ornamental plants. The current study isolates and identifies endophytic fungi from the leaves of Pachystachys lutea and evaluates the antagonistic activity of these endophytes as well as cellulase production by the endophytes. Fungi were isolated by fragmentation from surface-disinfected leaves and were identified by the sequencing of the ITS gene and the genes coding for EF 1-α and β-tubulin followed by multilocus sequence analysis. Molecular taxonomic analysis revealed that 78% of the identified fungi belonged to the genus Diaporthe. We also identified strains belonging to the genera Colletotrichum, Phyllosticta, Xylaria, Nemania, and Alternaria. Most of the strains tested were able to inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi, especially PL09 (Diaporthe sp.), which inhibited the growth of Colletotrichum sp., and PL03 (Diaporthe sp.), which inhibited the growth of Fusarium oxysporum. The production of cellulase ranged from 0.87 to 1.60 μmol/min. Foliar endophytic fungal isolates from P. lutea showed promising results for the in vitro control of plant pathogens and for cellulase production. This paper is the first report on culturable endophytic fungi isolated from the ornamental plant P. lutea. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	Article	Scopus

This system improves the Botrytis cinerea and Calonectria spp infection on the young eucalypts plantings, resulting gray mold and cutting rot respectively. Currently, the unique available control method is based on chemicals. As alternative, novel methods to manage plant diseases, endophytic microorganisms could be an interesting alternative. Thus, we aimed to evaluate endophytic Bacillus isolated from eucalypts as a biocontrol agent against Botrytis cinerea and Calonectria gracilis, important fungal pathogens in the greenhouse, using clonal plantlets of E. urograndis. Eight endophytic strains of Bacillus, previously described as eucalyptus growth promoters, were evaluated in vitro and in vivo against Botrytis cinerea and Calonectria gracilis. The diffusible metabolites assay showed the potential of endophytic Bacillus to decrease the growth of both pathogens. Differences in the susceptibility of the pathogens to bacterial volatile metabolites were observed, B. cinerea showed more susceptible than Calonectria gracilis. In vivo assays, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens EUCB 10 demonstrated better overall reductions in these diseases. Based on the results obtained from the in vitro and in vivo analyses, we suggest that the endophytic B. amyloliquefaciens strain EUCB 10 constitutes a promising biocontrol agent against B. cinerea and Calonectria gracilis. Furthermore, this is the first reporting of B. amyloliquefaciens previously describe as plant growth promoter and also as potential control agent of B. cinerea and Calonectria gracilis to eucalyptus. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Thus, we used the next-generation sequencing to assess the structure and diversity of bacterial communities in soils after 7 years of CTS application. CTS was applied at 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 Mg ha− 1 and the soil samples were collected at 75 days after application in the seventh year. The most abundant phyla were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Chloroflexi. The abundance of some specific groups increased with application of CTS, such as Anaerolinea S0208 and Firmicutes. Six bacterial genera differed between amended and unamended soil. The abundance of Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Symbiobacterium, Clostridium, Microlunatus, and Actinomadura increased after application of CTS. The Redundancy Analysis between the structure of the bacterial community and chemical variables in soil did not cluster all treatments clearly, but showed Cr, pH, and organic C as significant chemical variables that influenced the bacterial communities. Application of CTS in soil has a primary effect on the bacterial communities that, negatively, alter the bacterial diversity and community similarity, while that, positively, it permits to select specific bacterial groups able to resist and biodegrade contaminants. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We report a unique interaction among plant sex, bees, and endophytes on the dioecious shrub, Baccharis dracunculifolia (Asteraceae). We assessed whether there was an association between resin collection by bees and fungal endophytes considering the host plant sex. We hypothesized that resin collection by the Africanized honey bee, Apis mellifera L. (Apidae) could favor the entry of endophytes in B. dracunculifolia. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that (1) bees damage the leaf buds of female and male plant at different proportions; (2) damage on leaf buds increases the richness of endophytic fungi; (3) endophyte richness differs between female and male plants; and (4) in vitro growth of endophytes depends on the sex of the plant individual from which the resin was extracted. Endophyte richness and proportion of leaf bud damage did not vary between the plant sexes. However, species similarity of endophytes between female and male plants was 0.33. Undamaged leaf buds did not show culturable endophytes, with all fungi exclusively found in damaged leaf buds. Endophyte composition changed with the plant sex. The endophytes exclusively found in female plants did not develop in the presence of male resin extract. These findings highlight that resin collection by A. mellifera for propolis production favors the entry of endophytic fungi in B. dracunculifolia. Additionally, endophyte composition and growth are influenced by plant sex. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.	Article	Scopus

These cores were studied through pollen analysis and sedimentary features, and the results were discussed within a chronological framework provided by radiocarbon dating. The cores were sampled from fluvial terraces representative of channel, floodplain/lake and crevasse splay deposits formed since the mid-Holocene. The pollen samples derive from floodplain/lake deposits and the pollen grains are mainly composed by families Moraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Caesalpiniaceae, Fabaceae, Rubiaceae, Melastomataceae, Combretaceae, Sapindaceae, Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Aizoaceae, Apiaceae and genus Sebastiana. The pollen data suggest no significant vegetation changes in the study area for the past 4808-4886 cal yr BP. This led to proposing stable climatic conditions since at least the middle Holocene. Such a finding is contrary to the occurrence of a dry period during the middle Holocene. The stabilization of the relative sea level about 6000 cal yr BP along the northern Brazilian littoral may have influenced the water table, and favored the establishment and maintenance of Amazonian lowland forest during the mid- And late Holocene. In addition, this process may have attenuated the impact of that dry period in areas under most fluvial influence. © 2017 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona.

The setup comprises a flow system module with the ability to perform sample circulation using a closed-loop strategy, and a LED-based photometer. The photometric method is based on the reaction of Cd(ii) with 1,5-diphenylthiocarbazone (dithizone) in alkaline medium containing the surfactant Triton X-100. The combination of the closed-loop facility, which prevents sample dilution, with the beneficial effect of the long optical path length of the flow cell (200 mm), allows cadmium to be determined at μg L-1 levels without the need for a preconcentration step. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure was evaluated by analyzing water samples. The results show a linear response with concentrations ranging from 7.8 to 62.5 μg L-1 (r2 = 0.9989). The method has a limit of detection of 3.0 μg L-1, which is the guideline value established by the World Health Organization (WHO). A coefficient of variation of 1.6% (n = 10) for a 30.0 μg L-1 standard Cd(ii) solution, a reagent consumption of 4 μg dithizone per determination, and a sampling rate of 43 determinations per hour were also achieved. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

However, the effect of early N application on yield, plant N content, and N recovery efficiency (NRE) for corn is not yet well documented. Five fertilizer N timings in an oat-corn system were evaluated in two studies utilizing an isotopic-labeled N determination, 15N isotope. The N fertilization timings were: (i) oat tillering, (ii) 15 days before corn planting time, over the oat residues, (iii) at corn planting time, (iv) in-season at the three-leaf growth stage (V3), and (v) in-season split application at V3 and six-leaf (V6) growth stages. Based on the statistical analysis, the N fertilization timings were separated into three groups: 1) N-OATS, designated to N applied at oat; 2) N-PLANT, referred to pre-plant and planting N applications; and 3) N-CORN, designated to in-season corn N applications. Corn yield was not affected by the N fertilization timing. However, the N-CORN N fertilization timings enhanced NRE by 17% and 35% and final N recovery system (plant plus soil) by 16% and 24% all relative to N-OATS and N-PLANT groups, respectively. Overall, N-OATS resulted in the largest N derived from fertilizer (NDFF) amount in the deeper soil layer, in overall a delta of 10 kg N ha-1 relative to the rest of the groups. Notwithstanding corn yield was not affected, early N fertilization under subtropical conditions is not a viable option since NRE was diminished and the non-recovery N increased relative to the in-season N applications. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Relatively high concentrations (μg L− 1 range) have been found in tap waters in some countries, thus requiring fast and reliable procedures for its monitoring. In this work, a flow-based liquid-liquid microextraction procedure is proposed for preconcentration and separation of BPA, aiming at the determination based on its native fluorescence, which significantly increases in organic medium. Extraction was carried out in a sequential injection system by means of a film or the extractor formed on the tube walls (wetting film approach), followed by elution of this phase by ethanol. In this way, an enrichment factor of 15.5 was achieved with only 1.5 mL of sample and 30 μL of the extractor solvent. A linear response was observed from 5.0 to 100 μg L− 1 with a detection limit of 1.8 μg L− 1, sampling rate of 10 h− 1, and coefficient of variation of 2.3% (n = 10). The procedure was successfully applied to tap water samples and the results agreed with those obtained by the HPLC reference method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

For purposes of safety, easy operation, and analytical performance, a novel polytetrafluoroethylene lid with a screw valve which enables pressure relief without touching the pressurized vessel at the end of the digestion was developed for the CHDS vessels. The accuracy was checked by the analysis of three meat certified reference materials (CRMs) and the results obtained for the CHDS were compared to those of microwave-assisted digestion (MW). Blank values and carbon contents in digested samples using the CHDS were comparable to those of MW, being adequate for ICP OES and ICP-MS techniques. The recoveries for the analytes in the three CRMs varied from 85 to 110% when using the CHDS. The results found by the proposed CHDS were in agreement with those obtained by the MW comparative procedure. The limit of quantification (LOQ) values for the CHDS may be considered comparable to those of MW and adequate for raw meat analysis. The CHDS is an interesting alternative for macronutrients, micronutrients, and contaminants, and highlighted mainly the volatile elements (As, Cd, Pb and Se), which could be easily lost with open-vessel digestion systems. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Diabrotica speciosa (Germar) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) larvae are important maize (Zea mays L.) (Cyperales: Poaceae) root pests and finding native resistance in landraces would greatly contribute to maize-breeding programs aimed at controlling this pest. This study investigated whether the growth, survival, oviposition rhythm, fecundity, and fertility of D. speciosa are negatively influenced by specific maize landraces, and the existence of any morphological barriers in the roots that may correlate with plant resistance to the larval attack. Nineteen genotypes (17 landraces and 2 cultivars) were screened for antibiosis in assays that were conducted in the laboratory using seedling maize plants where the development time, longevity, weight, total survival, and sex ratio of adults were evaluated. Out of nineteen genotypes, eight were selected according to their resistance levels for an additional rearing study evaluating oviposition and fecundity. Landrace Pérola and cultivar SCS 154-Fortuna were classified as resistant because they increased the maturation period from larva to adult and decreased survivorship; and the landrace Palha Roxa was also classified as resistant for showing a lower fertility rate than other landraces. Resistant landraces that were infested by D. speciosa larvae showed greater amounts of some morphological barriers comparing with uninfested plants. The landraces classified as resistant may be considered in future plant-breeding programs, aiming to develop resistant maize cultivars to D. speciosa larval attack. © The Author(s) 2018.

Drought-tolerant common bean plants (cv. BAT 477), colonized by a mixture of AMF (Glomus clarum, Acaulospora scrobiculata, and Gigaspora rosea), were exposed to a water deprivation regime of 96 h during pre-flowering. Root transcriptomes were accessed through RNA-Seq revealing a set of 9,965 transcripts with significant differential regulation in inoculated plants during a water deficit event, and 10,569 in non-inoculated. These data include 1,589 transcripts that are exclusively regulated by AMF-inoculation, and 2,313 under non-inoculation conditions. Relative gene expression analyses of nine aquaporin-related transcripts were performed in roots and leaves of plants harvested at initial stages of treatment. Significant shifts in gene expression were detected in AM water deficit-treated roots, in relation to non-inoculated, between 48 and 72 h. Leaves also showed significant mycorrhizal influence in gene expression, especially after 96 h. Root cortical cells, harboring or not arbuscules, were collected from both inoculation treatments through a laser microdissection-based technique. This allowed the identification of transcripts, such as the aquaporin PvPIP2;3 and Glucan 1,3 β-Glucosidase, that are unique to arbuscule-containing cells. During the water deficit treatment, AMF colonization exerted a fine-tune regulation in the expression of genes in the host. That seemed to initiate in arbuscule-containing cells and, as the stressful condition persisted, propagated to the whole-plant through secondary signaling events. Collectively, these results demonstrate that arbuscular mycorrhization leads to shifts in common bean's transcriptome that could potentially impact its adaptation capacity during water deficit events. © 2018 Recchia, Konzen, Cassieri, Caldas and Tsai.

The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of cow bonechar amendments on the sorption-desorption and leaching of aminocyclopyrachlor and mesotrione in a tropical soil. Soil was amended with bonechar at rates of 0 (control), 1, 5, 10, and 100% (pure bonechar) (w w− 1), corresponding to 0, 12, 60, 120, and 1200 t ha− 1, respectively. Additionally, two bonechar particle size groups were compared (0.3–0.6 and 0.15–0.3 mm). Aminocyclopyrachlor (pyrimidine-2-14C-aminocyclopyrachlor) and mesotrione (cyclohexane-2-14C-mesotrione) sorption-desorption was evaluated using the batch-equilibrium method and column leaching studies. Higher bonechar application rates increased the sorption of both herbicides. Aminocyclopyrachlor and mesotrione were leachable in the control soil, but the addition of bonechar reduced the depth at which both herbicides were detected. Bonechar additions to soil, regardless of the particle size, was able to statistically increase sorption, decrease desorption, and reduce the leaching potential of both herbicides in the soil. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The apomictic mode of reproduction in this species, in addition to differences in ploidy between sexual and apomictic plants, impairs crossbreeding. The development of a methodology to transform apomictic cultivars will provide an option to introduce agronomic important traits to B. brizantha cv. Marandu. In addition, it will open the possibility to study in vivo the function of candidate genes involved in the apomictic reproduction. The objective of this work was to evaluate peeled seeds, isolated embryo from mature seeds, embryogenic calluses and embryogenic cell suspensions, as target explant for genetic transformation via biolistics. Plasmids bearing the marker genes gus and hptII under the control of the rice actin 1 promoter (pAct1-Os) or the maize ubiquitin 1 promoter (pUbi1Zm) were used. All the targetexplants used were suitable for transient gene expression after bombardment, showing gus expression and resistance to hygromycin. Using embryogenic calluses and cell suspensions as target tissues, transgenic plants were regenerated and transgenes detected. © 2018, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias. All rights reserved.

Benchtop microprobe X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (μ-XRF) presents a huge potential for facing this challenge. Excitation beams of 30 μm and 1 mm in diameter were employed to address questions in seed technology, phytopathology, plant physiology, and bioremediation. Different elements were analyzed in several situations of agronomic interest: (i) Examples of μ-XRF yielding quantitative maps that reveal the spatial distribution of zinc in common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) primed seeds. (ii) Chemical images daily recorded at a soybean leaf (Glycine max) infected by anthracnose showed that phosphorus, sulfur, and calcium trended to concentrate in the disease spot. (iii) In vivo measurements at the stem of P. vulgaris showed that under root exposure, manganese is absorbed and transported nearly 10-fold faster than iron. (iv) Quantitative maps showed that the lead distribution in a leaf of Eucalyptus hybrid was not homogenous, this element accumulated mainly in the leaf border and midrib, the lead hotspots reached up to 13,400 mg lead kg-1 fresh tissue weight. These case studies highlight the ability of μ-XRF in performing qualitative and quantitative elemental analysis of fresh and living plant tissues. Thus, it can probe dynamic biological phenomena non-destructively and in real time. © 2018 Rodrigues, Gomes, Duran, Cassanji, da Cruz, Sant’Anna Neto, Savassa, de Almeida and Carvalho.	Article	Scopus

Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus), palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha), and signal grass (Urochloa decumbens) were evaluated. Palisade grass showed the highest organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, lignin, and lower-crude protein content. Signal grass had the highest values for hemicellulose and neutral detergent fiber-nitrogen, and the lowest-cellulose content. Guinea grass and signal grass showed a higher-total gas production than palisade grass. Besides, Guinea grass showed an increased CH4 production, and palisade grass showed lower value for truly degraded organic matter, and reduced partitioning factor, in comparison to signal grass. An increased CH4 production was observed in cases of lower hemicellulose and paratitioning factor. The nutritive value and CH4 production of forages may be employed as parameters, aiming at the sustainability of ruminant production. © 2018 Embrapa.	Article	Scopus

In order to improve our understanding of the formation of sombric horizons we studied these soils in southern Brazil from various perspectives. The lateral configuration and grain size distribution excluded the possibility that the sombric horizon is a paleosol covered by an eolian deposit or colluvium. Micromorphology showed intense biological activity, indicating strong bioturbation. The absence of clay and OM coatings indicates that the sombric horizon in the study area was not formed by illuviation. Considering changes with depth, phytoliths and δ13C isotopes clearly showed that the OM from the sombric horizon had a larger contribution from grasses, while a larger contribution from black carbon (BC) was evidenced by the molecular composition. A larger contribution from grasses and BC both correspond to drier climatic conditions. However, similar depth trends for δ13C and PAHs were found in the reference profile (without sombric horizon), in agreement with climatic change but not explaining the different morphology. The molecular composition and C/N ratio showed that the profiles differed in degree of decomposition, with the OM in the soils that contained a sombric horizon being more decomposed than that in the reference profile. The sombric horizon is thus a remnant of an earlier phase of soil formation under a drier climate, which is made visible by differences in decomposition of OM related to subsequent more humid conditions. Stronger decomposition in the profiles with a sombric horizon may be related to better drainage, explaining their occurrence in the highest positions within the landscape and suggesting a topographic control. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The particles are usually accommodated inside packed-bed mini-columns, cartridges or disks, but this geometry may led to limited analyte/particle interaction, poor renewal of the particle surface, swelling effects, establishment of preferential pathways, and increased backpressure. These hindrances are circumvented by fluidizing the solid particles. Fluidization is a worldwide-accepted industrial process, which can be successfully implemented in flow analysis. This review emphasizes historical and conceptual aspects, as well as advantages, limitations, applications, and perspectives for future development of flow analysis relying on fluidized particles. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

LIBS instrumental parameters were evaluated using factorial design with a central point. The variables evaluated were delay time (0.0; 1.0 and 1.8 μs) and fluence (81; 2037 and 4074 Jcm−2): both were tested in three different values. The best results obtained were with a delay time of 1.8 μs and a fluence of 4074 Jcm−2. The proposed calibration model obtained using LIBS data presented a good correlation with reference values obtained by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP OES). The predictive capabilities, based on the standard error of validation (SEV), were 117, 530 and 77 mg kg−1 for Ca, K, and Mg, respectively. The proposed LIBS method was applied to the analysis of 90 cassava flour samples, and the results showed concentrations of Ca, K, and Mg of 352–1845, 1285–3187, and 320–1242 mg kg−1, respectively. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

To measure the extent of corn (Zea mays L.) foliar uptake of NH3 derived from surface applied urea at different growth stages and study the relationship between the amount of NH3 uptake and corn leaf area, a field experiment was set up during the 2011–2012 and the 2012–2013 growing seasons. The experiment was developed in a complete randomized blocks design with four replications. Treatments consisted of five sidedress N application times (growth stages V4, V6, V8, V10, and V12) using15 N-labeled urea. The percentage of volatilized N (VN), the percentage of volatilized N recovered by the plant (PVNP), and the leaf area (LA) at each N application time were evaluated. Using the tray method, the VN varied from 23 to 68% of the total N applied, given these differences mainly related to climatic conditions (i.e., rainfall occurrence). On average for the two growing seasons, measured PVNP values were 3.4, 5.5, 6.2, 9.0, and 14.8% at V4, V6, V8, V10, and V12 growth stages, respectively. Approximately 90% of the total N uptake (15 NH3, by the foliage) was allocated in the leaves and 10% in the stem. We found a high correlation between LA and PVNP (r2 = 0.92, p ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, corn plants can take up part of the surface applied fertilizer-derived (urea) NH3, up to values of 15% of the volatilized N–NH3. © 2018 by the American Society of Agronomy.

In the current study, our aim was to analyze the effect of S nutrition on the metabolic profile and the synthesis of GSH and PCs in Panicum maximum cv. Massai (Massai grass) used for Cd phytoextraction, since this forage grass shows fast growth, high biomass production, and adaptation to soil and climatic adversities. We evaluated in a greenhouse combinations of three S (0.1, 1.9 and 3.7 mmol L−1) and two Cd concentrations (0.1 and 0.5 mmol L−1) in nutrient solution, within a single growth period. The tissues of plants exposed to Cd showed distinct responses related to the primary metabolism. Tryptophan, lysine, and histidine were more accumulated in all tissues when Massai grass was exposed to Cd and was grown with 1.9 and/or 3.7 mmol L−1 S, which indicates that these amino acids are probably involved in Cd accumulation and detoxification in this plant. Among the sugars and sugar derivatives detected, galactinol appears to be the most active in decrease Cd-induced oxidative stress. Although there was no effect of Cd/S combinations on the expression of the genes encoding GSH1 and PCS2, the levels of GSH and PCs were strongly increased by Cd, mainly in roots and samples comprising both stem and sheath material of Massai grass and independently of different metabolic changes occurring in these tissues. Synthesis of the majority of metabolites evaluated in this study was mostly induced when Cd-exposed Massai grass was supplied with 1.9 mmol L−1 S, but more studies in field conditions are necessary to define the optimal S concentration for the plants grown in soil. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This work investigated whether hydrogen sulfide (H                             2                             S) acts upstream or downstream of nitric oxide (NO) in the signaling cascade during tomato response to salt stress. An NO-donor incremented H                             2                             S levels by 12–18.9% while an H                             2                             S-donor yielded 10% more NO in roots. The NO accumulated in roots one-hour after NaCl treatment while H                             2                             S accumulation started two-hour later. The NO stimulated H                             2                             S accumulation in roots/leaves, but not the opposite (i.e H                             2                             S was unable to stimulate NO accumulation) two-hour post NaCl treatment. Also, NO accumulation was accompanied by an increment of transcript levels of genes that encode for H                             2                             S-synthesizing enzymes.

Total and partial trace element concentrations were determined, and As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn were found above local reference values. These metals were also higher than the threshold effect level (TEL) in some sampling points and Zn was higher than probable effect level (PEL) oriented values in almost all sampling points. The most polluted points were identified from Tietê to Barra Bonita Counties. Regarding sediment quality, this river is still polluted and precautions to minimize environmental problems caused by toxic metals to biota and to human health are necessary. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

Forensic practitioners use fundamentals of chemistry and physics to examine evidence and infer its origin. In this regard, ecological researchers have had a significant impact on forensic science through the development and application of a specialized measurement technique—isotope analysis—for examining evidence. Here, we review the utility of isotope analysis in forensic settings from an ecological perspective, concentrating on work from the Americas completed within the last three decades. Our primary focus is on combining plant and animal physiological models with isotope analyses for source inference. Examples of the forensic application of isotopes—including stable isotopes, radiogenic isotopes, and radioisotopes—span from cotton used in counterfeit bills to anthrax shipped through the U.S. Postal Service and from beer adulterated with cheap adjuncts to human remains discovered in shallow graves. Recent methodological developments and the generation of isotope landscapes, or isoscapes, for data interpretation promise that isotope analysis will be a useful tool in ecological and forensic studies for decades to come. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the inventory and dynamics of biomass in the period (2007-2010) in dense rain forest in two areas of research in the National Forest – Tapajos, eastern Amazonia, called Area 1 and Area 2, 45 km distant from each other. The biomass was estimated using allometric equation and DAP, from 12 permanent plots, with six in each area. The results showed a significant difference in annual average stock biomass between Area 1 (293.19 ± 27.74, 298.21 ± 31.73, 299.60 ± 29.46, 298.11 ± 29.40 Mg. ha-1) and Area 2 (254.35 ± 69.61, 259.10 ± 70.05, 261.00 ± 69.43, 248.92 ± 61.78 Mg.ha-1). Besides that, it was noted annual change in stock biomass measurements at intervals of greater than one year due to fluctuations in mortality, recruitment and growth, besides the basal area and abundance of individuals in each area. The highest concentration of individuals occurred in diametric classes DAP 10 ≤ DAP ≤ 30 cm, however, it was verified that individuals with DAP ≥ 60 cm in lower concentration stored biomass equivalent to diametric classes 10 ≤ DAP ≤ 30 cm. We conclude that fluctuations in mortality, recruitment and growth, and abundance and basal area of these sites affected the stock biomass. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

Currently, extensive areas of low-intensity pasture are being converted to sugarcane, while management in the remaining pasture is becoming more intensive, i.e., includes tilling and fertilizer use. In this study, we assessed how such changes in land use and management practices alter emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CO2, N2O and CH4 by measuring in situ fluxes for one year after conversion from low-intensity pasture to conventional sugarcane agriculture and management-intensive pasture. Results show that CO2 and N2O fluxes increased significantly in pasture and sugarcane with tillage, fertilizer use, or both combined. Emissions were highly variable for all GHGs, yet, cumulatively, it was clear that annual emissions in CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) were higher in management-intense pasture and sugarcane than in unmanaged pasture. Surprisingly, tilled pasture with fertilizer (management-intensive pasture) resulted in higher CO2-eq emissions than conventional sugarcane. We concluded that intensification of pasture management and the conversion of pasture to sugarcane can increase the emission factor (EF) estimated for sugarcane produced in Brazil. The role of management practices and environmental conditions and the potential for reducing emissions are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

In this sense, our aim in this study was to evaluate in an integrated manner the effect of S supply (0.1, 1.9, and 3.7 mmol L−1) on root development and nutrient uptake of Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Massai (Massai grass) exposed to Cd (0.1, and 0.5 mmol L−1), and the implications of this effect for Cd phytoextraction. Root development of Massai grass was strongly inhibited when plants were exposed to 0.5 mmol L−1 Cd, but adequate S supply (1.9 mmol L−1) allowed for higher Cd uptake. On the other hand, there was a greater development of roots when Massai grass was exposed to 0.1 mmol L−1 Cd, while some strategies to restrict Cd entry, such as deposition of suberin and lignin in the endodermis and G-layer development, were observed. Adequate supply of S to these plants increased root length, root surface, Cd transport from roots to stems + sheaths, and N, S, and Mn concentrations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

The ewes were divided into two treatment groups depending on their diet: chopped aruana grass hay (Panicum maximum cv. Aruana) (control—CON); and aruana grass hay supplemented with chopped macrotiloma hay (macrotiloma—MAC). The animals were kept for 5 consecutive days in metabolic cages for the ATTD assay, and at the end of this period, samples of rumen fluid were collected from each ewe to determine ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N) and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and protozoa count. For the in vitro assay, a decrease in total gas and CH4 production was observed for samples incubated without PEG (p <.05). No differences were observed for the other parameters evaluated (p >.05). In the in vivo experiment, increased intake and ATTD of crude protein were observed for the animals fed MAC when compared to CON (p <.05). For rumen fermentation parameters, increased NH3-N, total SCFA and isobutyrate concentrations, as well as reduced protozoa count were observed for MAC when compared to CON (p <.05). The results observed here indicated the potential of macrotiloma for use as a ruminant feed, and antimethanogenic potential of this plant was noted. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH	Article	Scopus

The objectives of this study were to evaluate; (i) cation desorption by the CP and (ii) the efficiency of a new methodology of CPs treatment to decrease the cation desorption. The study was carried out in laboratory. The experimental design was completely randomized with two treatments and three replications; a) external washing of CP with deionized water + washing in HCl (0.1 mol L-1) solution + 4 washing cycles with deionized water (HCl+A); b) No washing of CP (S). The extracted solution from each treatment (HCl+A and S) was compared with deionized water (blank –TB). There was no significant desorption of N, P, K, S, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn and Al by the CPs. Ca, Mg and Na were desorbed by CP and had the following concentrations: 6.73, 0.20 and 0.70 mg L-1 respectively. They interfered significantly on the extracted solution when compared with TB solution. After the CPs treatment, Ca and Na concentration on solution were below the limit of detection, and Mg concentration was 0.01 mg L-1, and there was no difference from the blank solution. © 2018, Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP.

The study of Cd sorption in soil and its fractionation is an interesting tool for the evaluation of Cd affinity with soil pools. The objective with this study was to evaluate Cd sorption and desorption in tropical soils with variable charge (three Oxisols), in a Mollisol and in two Entisols with diverse physical, chemical, and mineralogical attributes. We used a thermodynamic approach to evaluate Cd sorption and performed a chemical fractionation of Cd in the six soils. Data from Cd sorption fit the Langmuir model (r > 0.94), and the sorption capacity ranged from 0.33 to 11.5 mmol kg−1. The Gibbs standard free energy was positively correlated to Cd sorption capacity (r = 0.74, except for the Quartzipsamments), and it was more favorable in soils with great sorption capacity. Distribution of Cd among fractions was not affected (t test, α = 0.05) by initial concentration, and there was a predominance of Cd extractable in 0.1 mol L−1 CaCl2. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

We used a process- and individual-based ecosystem model (ED2) to quantify the forest's vulnerability to increased drought recurrence. We generated meteorologically realistic, drier-than-observed rainfall scenarios for two Amazon forest sites, Paracou (wetter) and Tapajós (drier), to evaluate the impacts of more frequent droughts on forest biomass, structure and composition. The wet site was insensitive to the tested scenarios, whereas at the dry site biomass declined when average rainfall reduction exceeded 15%, due to high mortality of large-sized evergreen trees. Biomass losses persisted when year-long drought recurrence was shorter than 2–7 yr, depending upon soil texture and leaf phenology. From the site-level scenario results, we developed regionally applicable metrics to quantify the Amazon forest's climatological proximity to rainfall regimes likely to cause biomass loss > 20% in 50 yr according to ED2 predictions. Nearly 25% (1.8 million km2) of the Amazon forests could experience frequent droughts and biomass loss if mean annual rainfall or interannual variability changed by 2σ. At least 10% of the high-emission climate projections (CMIP5/RCP8.5 models) predict critically dry regimes over 25% of the Amazon forest area by 2100. © 2018 The Authors.

The procedure was implemented by using a binary search algorithm and a multicommuted flow analysis approach. Solution-handling setup included a homemade syringe pump and a set of solenoid valves, which were assembled to treat the solution-handling as a time function controlled by a microcomputer. Photometer detection was performed using a compact homemade light emitting diode (LED)-based photometer. Aiming to evaluate the accuracy, samples were analyzed by employing the methodologies recommended by the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (ABNT) and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Accuracy was assessed by applying the Student’s t-test for paired samples at the 95% confidence level (n = 4), which shown that there is no significant difference between results. Other useful features included relative standard deviation of < 1% and waste generation volume ten times lower than those produced by ABNT and ASTM methods. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

N2fixation was higher during the wet summer than during the dry winter both in acacia monocultures and in mixed plantations. Context: Introducing N-fixing trees in fast-growing tropical plantations may contribute to reducing the long-term requirements of N fertilizers. Management practices established in forest monocultures should be revisited in mixed-species plantations. Aims: This field experiment aimed to compare N2 fixation rates of Acacia mangium Wild in monospecific stands and in mixed-species stands with Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden. A secondary objective was to gain insight into the seasonal variations of N2 fixation. Methods: 15N was applied to acacia and eucalypt monocultures and mixed-species with a 1:1 ratio at mid rotation. Leaves were collected in autumn, winter, spring, and summer to determine the foliar N concentrations and 15N atom fraction. The N content in the above-ground biomass was estimated as well as the percentage of N derived from atmospheric N2 (%Ndfa) using eucalypts in monoculture as reference plants. Results: %Ndfa values averaged over the year were 14% in monoculture and 44% in mixed-species stands. While the stocking density of acacia trees was twice as high in monoculture as in mixture, the amounts of N fixed in above-ground biomass of acacia trees were close (35–39 kg N ha−1) at 39 months after planting. %Ndfa values were higher during the wet summer than the dry winter both in acacia monocultures and in mixed plantations. Conclusion: The stocking density of acacia trees can be reduced in mixed plantations with eucalypts in comparison to acacia monocultures with a low influence on the input of N to soil through biological fixation. © 2018, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

Here we present results of a replicated experimental study in a degraded cattle pasture of eastern Amazonia using mass balance and a 15N tracer in lined soil pit mesocosms with three treatments: (1) plant-free control plots, (2) pasture grass Brachiaria brizantha, and (3) regrowth of early successional secondary forest species. Accumulation of N in grass biomass slightly exceeded estimates of net N mineralization from the plant-free control plots but was within the margin of error, so inputs of BNF may not have been needed. In contrast, the secondary forest vegetation accumulated about 3 times as much biomass N annually as the net N mineralization estimate, suggesting at least some role for BNF. Based on isotopic and mass measurements of N-fixing species, BNF was estimated to contribute at least 27 ± 3% of mean annual plant uptake in the secondary forest regrowth vegetation plots. Although BNF is probably important for recuperation of tropical secondary forests following land use change, the majority of the N taken up by both grasses and secondary forest regrowth arose from mineralization of the stocks of soil N. ©2018.

The thermogravimetric curves showed four mass losses. A small displacement was observed for the second loss, which occurred for the irradiated flours, compared to the control sample. The irradiated samples showed a slight decrease in the thermal parameters: initial temperature (To), peak temperature (Tp) and gelatinisation enthalpy (△H). All the black rice flours exhibited A-type crystallinity pattern, and the gamma radiation did not change the XRD patterns or the degree of crystallinity. The micro-images obtained using FEG–SEM showed a composite of organic and heterogeneous material; after gamma radiation, some changes occurred, such as cracks, pores and smaller fragments. The pasting properties decreased significantly with irradiation. The decrease in setback and breakdown viscosity after irradiation suggested an indication that it may be possible to improve the quality of food based on black rice flours. Gamma radiation can be a useful tool to modify rice flours in order to suit various functionalities and to help meet the growing demands of the food industry. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

Four buffaloes with fistula in the rumen were fed with roughage grass hay (70%) and concentrate (30%) consisting ground grain corn and ground grain raw soybean (RAS treatment) or roasted soybean (RSB Treatment). Total collection of feces and urine were performed to estimate the apparent digestibility of dry matter, crude protein and neutral detergent fiber; urinary excretion of purine derivatives (PD), and rumen contents sampling to identification and counting of ciliate protozoa population. The apparent digestibility of the crude protein was higher in the animals receiving diets with roasted soybean (63.45%) than with raw soybean (47.16%). But, no significant differences were observed in the DM and NDF digestibility. Purine derivatives excretion did not differ between treatments, maintaining relative proportion of allantoin: uric acid of 89:11%. The average synthesis of microbial nitrogen was estimated in 33.88 g/d. We have concluded that substitution of the raw by roasted soybean in the diet for buffalo has promoted increase in the apparent digestibility of crude protein, and reduction of total number and Entodinium protozoa population in the rumen, but had no influence in the composition of the fauna, excretion of PD, and microbial protein synthesis. © 2018, International Buffalo Information Center, Kasetsart University.

Seventy samples of Brazilian shoyu were analyzed and compared with the same product from Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan, and United States. The average (±standard-deviation) δ13C of the Brazilian shoyu was −15.0 ± 3.4. The average (±standard-deviation) δ13C of five shoyu samples from Japan was −25.2 ± 0.6‰. The δ13C of shoyu from US (−25.3‰) and Singapore (−25.9‰) were close to Japanese samples. Shoyu δ13C values from China were equal to −20‰ and −15.4‰ and from Taiwan equal to −20.2‰. The average δ15N value of Brazilian shoyu was 0.3 ± 1.2‰. The variability of δ15N values among shoyu from other countries was much lower than Brazilian shoyu, and the average was 1.4 ± 0.3‰. Using a simple isotopic mass balance, we estimated that most of the shoyu in Brazil contains <20% soy, and the dominant cereal is maize, probably because in Brazil maize is cheaper than soybean. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In addition to the deleterious effects of blooms on aquatic ecosystems, the majority of ecotypes can synthesize toxic secondary metabolites causing public health issues. To overcome the harmful effects of C. raciborskii blooms, it is important to advance knowledge of diversity, genetic variation, and evolutionary processes within populations. An efficient approach to exploring this diversity and understanding the evolution of C. raciborskii is to use comparative genomics. Here, we report two new draft genomes of C. raciborskii (strains CENA302 and CENA303) from Brazilian isolates of different origins and explore their molecular diversity, phylogeny, and evolutionary diversification by comparing their genomes with sequences from other strains available in public databases. The results obtained by comparing seven C. raciborskii and the Raphidiopsis brookii D9 genomes revealed a set of conserved core genes and a variable set of accessory genes, such as those involved in the biosynthesis of natural products, heterocyte glycolipid formation, and nitrogen fixation. Gene cluster arrangements related to the biosynthesis of the antifungal cyclic glycosylated lipopeptide hassallidin were identified in four C. raciborskii genomes, including the non-nitrogen fixing strain CENA303. Shifts in gene clusters involved in toxin production according to geographic origins were observed, as well as a lack of nitrogen fixation (nif) and heterocyte glycolipid (hgl) gene clusters in some strains. Single gene phylogeny (16S rRNA sequences) was congruent with phylogeny based on 31 concatenated housekeeping protein sequences, and both analyses have shown, with high support values, that the species C. raciborskii is monophyletic. This comparative genomics study allowed a species-wide view of the biological diversity of C. raciborskii and in some cases linked genome differences to phenotype. © 2018 Abreu, Popin, Alvarenga, Schaker, Hoff-Risseti, Varani and Fiore.

This review focuses on the main developments and advances in LIBS and XRF in the analysis of plant materials over the last ten years. Fundamental aspects and instrumentation are given for both techniques. The developments in the quantitative analysis of plant leaves are discussed, with special emphasis on the key aspects and challenges concerning field sampling protocols, sample preparation, and calibration strategies. Microchemical imaging applications by LIBS and XRF (including synchrotron radiation) are also presented in a broader selection of plant compartments (e.g., leaves, roots, stems, and seeds). Challenges, expectations and complementarities of LIBS and XRF towards plant nutrition diagnosis are thoroughly discussed. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.	Review	Scopus

By strain-genotyping all field-collected individuals we found that populations collected from corn were composed primarily of corn-strain individuals, while the population collected from rice was composed almost entirely of rice-strain individuals. Outlier analyses indicated 1,184 loci putatively under selection (ca. 15% of the total) related to 194 different Gene Ontologies (GOs); the most numerous GOs were nucleotide binding, ATP binding, metal-ion binding and nucleic-acid binding. The association analyses indicated 326 loci associated with the host plant, and 216 loci associated with the individual strain, including functions related to Bacillus thuringiensis and insecticide resistance. The genetic-structure analyses indicated a moderate level of differentiation among all populations, and lower genetic structure among populations collected exclusively from corn, which suggests that the population collected from rice has a strong influence on the overall genetic structure. Populations of S. frugiperda are structured partially due to the host plant, and pairs of populations using the same host plant are more genetically similar than pairs using different hosts. Loci putatively under selection are the main factors responsible for the genetic structure of these populations, which indicates that adaptive selection on important traits, including the response to control tactics, is acting in the genetic differentiation of FAW populations in Brazil. © 2018 Silva-Brandão et al.

To partition influences across various timescales, we use a statistical model to represent eddy-covariance-derived NEE in an evergreen eastern Amazon forest as a constant response to changing meteorology and phenology throughout a decade. Our best fit model represented hourly NEE variations as changes due to sunlight, while seasonal variations arose from phenology influencing photosynthesis and from rainfall influencing ecosystem respiration, where phenology was asynchronous with dry-season onset. We compared annual model residuals with biometric forest surveys to estimate impacts of drought disturbance. We found that our simple model represented hourly and monthly variations in NEE well (R 2 Combining double low line 0.81 and 0.59, respectively). Modeled phenology explained 1 % of hourly and 26 % of monthly variations in observed NEE, whereas the remaining modeled variability was due to changes in meteorology. We did not find evidence to support the common assumption that the forest phenology was seasonally light- or water-triggered. Our model simulated annual NEE well, with the exception of 2002, the first year of our data record, which contained 1.2 MgC ha'1 of residual net emissions, because photosynthesis was anomalously low. Because a severe drought occurred in 1998, we hypothesized that this drought caused a persistent, multi-year depression of photosynthesis. Our results suggest drought can have lasting impacts on photosynthesis, possibly via partial damage to still-living trees. © Author(s) 2018.	Article	Scopus

In this work, the concentrations of carbon and differences in its composition (humification indexes) were evaluated and compared for several horizons (0 to 390 cm) of three typical Amazonian podzol profiles. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to investigate the humic acid (HA) fractions of SOM isolated from the different samples. Simple and labile carbon structures appeared to be accumulated in surface horizons, while more complex humified compounds were leached and accumulated in intermediate and deeper Bh horizons. The results suggested that the humic acids originated from lignin and its derivatives, and that lignin could accumulate in some Bh horizons. The HA present in deeper Bh horizons appeared to originate from different formation pathways, since these horizons showed different compositions. There were significant compositional changes of HA with depth, with four types of organic matter: recalcitrant, humified, and old dating; labile and young dating; humified and young dating; and little humified and old dating. Therefore, the humification process had no direct relation with the age of the organic matter in the Amazonian podzols. © 2017	Article	Scopus

In many cases, however, the morphotypes assigned to this genus do not share a common ancestor based on 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, which has led to the description of novel genera, such as Nodosilinea, Oculatella, Pantanalinema, Alkalinema, Thermoleptolyngbya, Onodrimia, Timaviella and Toxifilum. Thus, four novel isolates, with a comparable morphology to Leptolyngbya, were recovered from the Amazon and Solimões rivers. The novel 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from these strains were placed together as a new and distinct phylogenetic lineage that is more closely related to the clusters embracing the genera Nodosilinea, Haloleptolyngbya and Halomicronema than to the genus Leptolyngbya. Additionally, these novel 16S rRNA gene sequences showed similarity values lower than 95 % compared with those from the most phylogenetic related groups and/or established genera. Altogether, these results supported the erection of a novel genus, named Amazoninema, to accommodate the novel isolates. Likewise, a comparison of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed similarities higher than 99.8 %, indicating that they belong to a single species, which was corroborated by analysing their 16S–23S internal transcribed spacer regions and unique Box-B helix pattern. Few studies have been undertaken to uncover the cultured diversity of cyanobacteria from Amazonia, and to our knowledge, this is the first cyanobacteria genus erected, considering morphotypes isolated exclusively from Brazilian Amazonian rivers. © 2018 IUMS.

Fifteen male lambs (21.1 ± 1.50 kg) of the Santa Inês hair breed of approximately six months old, distributed in the treatments infected (I, n = 8) and control (C, n = 7) were used. The infected lambs received serial infections with 5000 T. colubriformis larvae, three times per week, for 3 weeks (45 000 T. colubriformis total larvae). After 66 days of the last inoculation of infective larvae, 6.6 MBq of 32P were injected in each lamb to evaluate the P kinetics. Blood, faeces and urine samples were collected in the following seven days and the slaughter of lambs were carried out on the last day in order to collect bone and soft tissues (Liver, kidney, heart and muscle) samples. To analyse P flows, the biomathematical model with four compartments (C1 - gastrointestinal tract, C2 - plasma, C3 - bone and C4 - soft tissue) was used. Similar P intake (VI) between treatments (C and I) was verified. Lower absorption of endogenous (Vaf) and dietary P (Vaa), as well as, lower amount of endogenous P (from saliva) that reaches the gastrointestinal tract (VIT), consequently, higher excretion of dietary P (VFD) were verified in infected lambs (P < 0.1). Additionally, in infected lambs, the P bioavailability was lower compared to control lambs. With the lower absorption (VaT) of P in infected lambs, there was, consequently, lower distribution to bones and soft tissues (VeD2) and lower P deposition in the bones (VO+D). It was concluded that P metabolism of lambs infected with T. colubriformis was altered, with reduced intestinal absorption and bioavailability, increased faecal loss and reduced P flow to the bone. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

One of the threats that can reduce Eucalyptus production is the eucalyptus rust disease caused by Austropuccinia psidii, a biotrophic fungus that affects a broad range of Myrtaceae. An accurate diagnosis tool for the early detection of rust disease could be useful in breeding programs for selection of resistant plants against rust, in phytosanitary purposes or in rust epidemics studies. The aim of the present work was to develop a SYBR Green-based quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for the early detection and quantification of A. psidii in Eucalyptus grandis leaves. Three sets of primers based on the A. psidii ribosomal DNA intergenic space region (IGS), beta-tubulin and elongation factor genes were designed and evaluated. The assays using the IGS primer set resulted in the highest detection efficiency, detecting a lower limit of 0.5 pg of A. psidii DNA. Under artificial inoculation in plants, A. psidii was detected immediately after pathogen inoculation until 240 h post-inoculation using qPCR. In field validation of the method, A. psidii was detected using qPCR in naturally infected leaves with or without rust symptoms. This easy and fast method can be used for an efficient detection of A. psidii in E. grandis leaves. The implications of this tool for rust studies are discussed below. © 2017, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.	Article	Scopus

Currently, conventional water treatment techniques do not have high capacity to remove herbicides; therefore, the need to study other techniques arises. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of the removal of diuron and hexazinone herbicides present in water through a commercial filtration system. The study was carried out in a filtration system composed of the following sequence of filters: sand filter and coconut shell activated granular carbon, polypropylene filter 20 mm, activated carbon filter with silver salts, polypropylene filter 5 mm and reverse osmosis. The affluent contained an initial concentration of 12.06 mg mL-1 of hexazinone and 37.70 mg mL-1 of diuron. The samples were collected in all filters and subjected to the analysis of turbidity and presence of herbicides by high performance liquid chromatography. The filter set removed 99.31; 99.84 and 99.99% of water turbidity, hexazinone and diuron respectively at the end of the system. After the filtration process, the treated water presented adequate quality for public supply and human consumption. The technique employed in this study is easy to operate and has a low acquisition and maintenance cost. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira da Ciencia das Plantas Daninha. All rights reserved.

Later during development petals are required to open the flower and to attract pollinators. This diverse set of functions demands tight temporal and spatial regulation of petal development. We studied the functioning of the Arabidopsis thaliana TCP5-like transcription factors (TFs) in petals. Overexpression of TCP5 in petal epidermal cells results in smaller petals, whereas tcp5 tcp13 tcp17 triple knockout lines have wider petals with an increased surface area. Comprehensive expression studies revealed effects of TCP5-like TFs on the expression of genes related to the cell cycle, growth regulation and organ growth. Additionally, the ethylene biosynthesis genes 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase 2 (ACS2) and ACC oxidase 2 (ACO2) and several ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORS (ERFs) are found to be differentially expressed in TCP5 mutant and overexpression lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation–quantitative PCR showed direct binding of TCP5 to the ACS2 locus in vivo. Ethylene is known to influence cell elongation, and the petal phenotype of the tcp5 tcp13 tcp17 mutant could be complemented by treatment of the plants with an ethylene pathway inhibitor. Taken together, this reveals a novel role for TCP5-like TFs in the regulation of ethylene-mediated petal development and growth. © 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for Experimental Biology.

At present, GIN control cannot rely on conventional anthelmintic (AH) drugs because parasites have developed resistance against such drugs. Thus, alternative control methods are being sought to reduce the dependence on AH. Many tannin-rich plants exhibit AH activity and may be used as alternatives for GIN control. Mimosa caesalpiniifolia is a tannin-rich shrub consumed by small ruminants in Brazil. This study evaluated the in vivo AH effect of M. caesalpiniifolia leaf powder supplementation on GIN egg fecal excretion and worm burden in goats. Plant leaves were harvested, dried and ground to obtain a powder. Twenty-four castrated male goats, aged six to eight months, with a mean body weight of 15.0 ± 2.5 kg were used in the experiment. Animals were infected orally with 16,000 larvae comprising 50% Haemonchus spp., 41% Trichostrongylus spp. and 9% Oesophagostomum spp. Once the infection was patent, the goats were distributed into four groups of six animals. The control group received concentrate without condensed tannins (CTs) and did not receive any drench against GINs. The monepantel group received concentrate without CTs and were drenched once with monepantel. The other two groups received the M. caesalpiniifolia leaf powder in two periods of seven consecutive days (days 1–7 and 14–21), with one of the groups also receiving 10 g of polyethyleneglycol (PEG)/day. The animals were weighed weekly, and individual fecal eggs counts (FECs) were performed daily. After 28 days, the animals were humanly slaughtered, and the worm burden was estimated. Although live weight gain and FECs did not differ among the groups (P > 0.05), post-mortem worm counts showed a reduction in Haemonchus contortus adult worm burden (57.7%) in goats of the CT group compared to control goats (P < 0.05). The addition of PEG did not diminish AH activity in the CT + PEG group (66.9% reduction compared to the control). No AH effect against other GIN species was found. The result for the addition of PEG suggested that the observed AH activity was associated with plant secondary compounds, as opposed to CTs. As expected, no AH effect against Oesophagostomum columbianum was found for the monepantel group showed. Thus, feeding dry leaves of M. caesalpiniifolia represent a promising alternative for the control of GIN infections in goats. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

However, other driving forces may be significantly affecting this system. Distinguishing allogenic and autogenic influence on mangroves is a challenging question, because mechanisms related to the natural dynamics of depositional environments (autogenic processes) have strong influences on the establishment and degradation of mangroves. Thus, impacts on mangroves caused by autogenic processes may be erroneously attributed to allogenic mechanisms. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the ‘fingerprint’ of global changes in modern mangrove dynamics. In order to characterize the influence of these forces on mangroves, this work has used geomorphology and vegetation maps integrated with sedimentological and palynological data, radiocarbon dating, as well as δ13C, δ15N and C/N from sedimentary organic matter. The inter-proxy analyses reveal an estuarine influence with mangrove development along the Ceará Mirim River, north-eastern Brazil, since ~6920 cal yr bp, after the post-glacial sea level rise. Relative sea level (RSL) has been stable during the middle and late Holocene. Mangrove establishment along this fluvial valley begins at about 6920 cal yr bp, caused by the sea-level stabilization, an allogenic influence. However, after its establishment, wetland dynamics were mainly controlled by autogenic factors, related to channel migrations, instead of allogenic process. Some influence of sea-level and climate changes on mangrove dynamics in this estuarine channel have been weakened by more intense tidal channels activities. Therefore, the expansion and contraction of mangrove areas along the estuary of the Ceará Mirim River since 6920 cal yr bp has been mainly influenced by channel dynamics that regulate the accretion and erosion of mangrove substrates.

The layered double hydroxide (LDH) compounds Zn2Al(OH)6·nH2O, Zn2Al0.75Fe0.25(OH)6·nH2O, ZnCuAl(OH)6·nH2O, and ZnCuAl0.5Fe0.5(OH)6·nH2O were prepared, each designed to specifically identify the physical barrier, radical trapping, and char formation contributions to the thermal stability of the PMMA-LDH nanocomposites. The unique combination of conventional methods (TG, DSC, and Raman spectroscopy) and synchrotron radiation techniques (XAS and WAXS), applied during PMMA-LDH heating, revealed the synergetic (of iron) and antagonist (of copper) effects of the LDH layers transformations on the three main endothermic steps of mass loss of the polymer. The diffusion barrier effect was proved by the downshift of the PMMA thermal decomposition temperature caused by the decrease of the LDH edifice thermostability when divalent cations were substituted in the LDH (passing from PMMA-Zn2Al(OH)6·nH2O to PMMA-ZnCuAl(OH)6·nH2O). For PMMA-Zn2Al0.75Fe0.25(OH)6·nH2O, a cooperative contribution of iron reduction, stabilisation of layered edifice, and radical trapping effects was observed for the thermal stability of the nanocomposite. LDH also acted as a diffusion barrier to the efflux and evaporation of depolymerized species, favouring the charring which exerts an additional contribution to thermal stability of the PMMA-LDH nanocomposites. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

However, information about the magnitude and duration of disturbances caused by crop and industrial wastes on soil microbial community structure and function is still scarce. The objective of this study was to investigate how added residues from industry and crops together with nitrogen (N) fertiliser affect the microbial community structure and function, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The experimental sugarcane field had the following treatments: (I) control with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK), (II) sugarcane straw with NPK, (III) vinasse (by-product of ethanol industry) with NP, and (IV) vinasse plus sugarcane straw with NP. Soil samples were collected on days 1, 3, 6, 11, 24 and 46 of the experiment for DNA extraction and metagenome sequencing. N2O emissions were also measured. Treatments with straw and vinasse residues induced changes in soil microbial composition and potential functions. The change in the microbial community was highest in the treatments with straw addition with functions related to decomposition of different ranges of C-compounds overrepresented while in vinasse treatment, the functions related to spore-producing microorganisms were overrepresented. Furthermore, all additional residues increased microorganisms related to the nitrogen metabolism and vinasse with straw had a synergetic effect on the highest N2O emissions. The results highlight the importance of residues and fertiliser management in sustainable agriculture. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

However, the capacity of individual plant species to withstand intense drought regimes remains unclear. Here, we evaluated ecophysiological responses from a forest community where we sampled 83 woody plant species during 5 years of experimental drought (throughfall exclusion) in an eastern Amazonian terra firme forest. Overall, the experimental drought resulted in shifts of some, but not all, leaf traits related to photosynthetic carbon uptake and intrinsic water-use efficiency. Leaf δ13C values increased by 2–3‰ within the canopy, consistent with increased diffusional constraints on photosynthesis. Decreased leaf C:N ratios were also observed, consistent with lower investments in leaf structure. However, no statistically significant treatment effects on leaf nitrogen content were observed, consistent with a lack of acclimation in photosynthetic capacity or increased production of nitrogen-based secondary metabolites. The results of our study provide evidence of robust acclimation potential to drought intensification in the diverse flora of an Amazonian forest community. The results reveals considerable ability of several species to respond to intense drought and challenge commonly held perspectives that this flora has attained limited adaptive plasticity because of a long evolutionary history in a favorable and stable climate. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

In a comparative slaughter trial, eighty-four ½ Dorper × ½ Santa Inês ram lambs (18.0 ± 3.3 kg of BW) were individually penned and divided into 2 diet groups differing in roughage source: low-quality (sugarcane bagasse) roughage (LQR) or medium-quality (coastcross hay) roughage (MQR). In each group, 7 lambs were randomly selected and slaughtered after a 10 days adaptation period (baseline). Other 21 lambs from each diet group were fed ad libitum and slaughtered at 25, 35, or 45 kg of BW, and the remaining 28 lambs (14 from each diet group) were submitted to 1 of 2 levels of feed restriction (70 or 50% of the ad libitum intake). Body N content and retention were determined. In the second trial, 6 ram lambs (44.3 ± 5.6 kg of BW) were kept in metabolic cages and used in a 6 × 6 Latin square experiment designed to determine N digestibility and microbial N synthesis, and to compute MP supply by the 2 diets and 3 levels of intake. Nitrogen intake and microbial N synthesis were greater for the animals fed the MQR diet than for those fed the LQR diet (P < 0.05). Neither the endogenous and metabolic N losses, nor the net protein requirements for growth differed between diets (P > 0.05). However, the proportion of MP used for both maintenance and growth was lower for the animals fed the MQR diet (P < 0.05), likely because of an excess of MP reaching duodenum of these animals. We concluded that a reduction of the concentrate level in diets for growing ram lambs, achieved by improving the quality of the diet roughage, allows a greater supply of MP and may contribute to reduce diet protein concentration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Its direct determination is time consuming and sometimes expensive because it requires extensive sampling, especially when spatial and temporal variation of soil hydraulic properties are an issue. The use of pedotransfer functions (PTFs) is a viable alternative to predict the parameters of SWRC from more easily determined soil attributes. Splintex is a physically based engineering model containing two PTFs to estimate SWRC parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity, but its performance and functionality have not yet been fully evaluated and disseminated for soil science. We examined the functionality of the PTFs available in Splintex to estimate parameters of the Van Genuchten–Mualem (VGM) SWRC equation with a laboratory-measured dataset containing information on particle size, bulk and particle density, saturated water content and parameters of the SWRCs. In addition, we tested the performance of both PTFs for deriving some soil physical–structural variables calculated from estimated SWRC parameters. Compared with VGM parameters fitted to the laboratory dataset, the model performed well. Its predictive performance for soil air capacity, relative field capacity and soil physical–structural quality indices was also evaluated. The performance of Splintex for estimating the VGM parameters depended on the combined effect of all input variables rather than on isolated correlations between an input variable and a model parameter. Highlights: Splintex provides two PTFs to estimate the Van Genuchten–Mualem parameters of the SWRC. In addition to PTF1 input, PTF2 needs an additional soil water content–retention observation. Performance of Splintex-PTF1 against measured data and -PTF2 prediction is presented. PTF2 provided better results than PTF1 for estimating SPQ indices. © 2018 British Society of Soil Science	Article	Scopus

This material protects PCBs against several types of damage and performance failure. In this study, the capabilities of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) were investigated for the direct analysis of solder masks typically commercialized for homemade PCB production, and inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to obtain a chemical profile for the target analytes Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, and Zn. Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was also employed for the determination of potentially toxic elements, such as As, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Hg. In addition to the qualitative information that may be useful for obtaining the spectral profile related to the raw materials present in solder masks formulations, LIBS was also applied for major elements (Al, Ba, Cu, Fe, Mg, and Zn) determination, but due to the low sensitivity, the obtained results were only semi-quantitative for Ba. Regarding Cd, Cr, Hg, and Pb, the samples analyzed were following the restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) directive of the European Union. © The Author(s) 2018.	Article	Scopus

Water savings practices such as aerobic system and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) are being evaluated in lowland rice systems. However, few studies have been conducted on this subject in tropical South America where soils are highly weathered. Thus, a three-year field experiment was conducted in Brazil on a lowland Plinthaquults to investigate crop performance, water input productivity (WPin) and N recovery under five irrigation regimes: continuous flooding (CF); AWD with short cycle (AWDS); AWD with long cycle (AWDL); saturated soil without ponded water (SS); and aerobic (AR). The drying events in AWDS occurred more frequently than in AWDL. The experimental design was a split-plot with irrigation regimes in the main plot and N fertilizer rate, 0 or 150 kg N ha−1, in the subplot. 15N micro-plots were set up to examine the fate of N fertilizer. The highest grain yields for 150N and 0N treatments resulted from the AR irrigation regime and averaged 9.1 and 6.5 mg ha−1, respectively. Yields among the others irrigations regimes varied from year to the next, but the average was 8.5 and 5.4 mg ha−1 in the 150N and 0N treatments, respectively. Higher yields are attributed to higher N uptake and greater N recovery in the AR treatment. Apparent N recovery averaged 58% in the AR treatment compared to 34% in the other treatments. Similarly, total recovery (plant and soil) of 15N in the AR treatment was 82%, compared to 62, 61, 56, 56% in SS, AWDS, AWDL, CF respectively. Higher N recovery in the AR was likely the result of lower N losses. Irrigation inputs ranged from 15 mm in the AR to 1337 mm in the CF treatment. The WPin (kg m−3) averaged 0.8 in AR, and 0.5, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.4 in SS, CF, AWDS, AWDL and CF. Thus, in this environment, rice productivity, water productivity, and N use efficiency were all enhanced in aerobic systems relative to continuous flooding or any alternative irrigation regime. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, soil metagenomes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were analyzed for alterations to microbial community composition, functional groups, and putative physiology as it related to land-use change and tropical soil. A total of 28 MAGs were assembled encompassing 10 phyla, including both dominant and rare biosphere lineages. Amazon Acidobacteria subdivision 3, Melainabacteria, Microgenomates, and Parcubacteria were found exclusively in pasture soil samples, while Candidatus Rokubacteria was predominant in the adjacent rainforest soil. These shifts in relative abundance between land-use types were supported by the different putative physiologies and life strategies employed by the taxa. This research provides unique biological insights into candidate phyla in tropical soil and how deforestation may impact the carbon cycle and affect climate change. © 2018 Kroeger, Delmont, Eren, Meyer, Guo, Khan, Rodrigues, Bohannan, Tringe, Borges, Tiedje, Tsai and Nüsslein.

However, there is a lack of studies comparing the effects of conservation technologies on the physicochemical and sensory quality of juçara pulp. This work aimed at evaluating the effects of gamma radiation (                             60                             Co) and pasteurization process on the physicochemical and sensory quality of juçara pulp. The irradiated (2.5 ± 0.06 kGy) and pasteurized (80°C/5 minutes) pulps were stored at 6°C, 90% RH, for 30 days (3 periods of analysis) and were analyzed for their microbiological, physicochemical (titratable acidity, soluble solids content, color, phenolic compounds, anthocyanin content, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase activity) and sensory parameters (acceptance test). The physicochemical results were submitted to ANOVA for the ‘F’ test and the statistical difference of averages (P < 0.05) was determined by the Tukey’s test. The results of the sensory analysis were submitted to Principal Component and Cluster Analysis. The gamma radiation did not show satisfactory results in the preservation of juçara pulp since there was a significant decrease in total phenolics and anthocyanin content. The pasteurized pulp maintained its physicochemical and sensory characteristics during storage. Therefore, we recommend the pasteurization as a good conservation technique to this kind of product, which presented a shelf-life of around 15 days.                          © 2018 Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Nine rumen cannulated Santa Inês sheep (55 ± 3.7 kg of body weight) were randomly divided into three groups to receive three experimental treatments: control (basal diet without additives); basal diet with 200 (EO200) mg of EO of a microencapsulated blend of essential oils (MBEO)/kg dietary DM offered; and basal diet with 400 (EO400) mg of EO of MBEO/kg dietary DM offered. The experiment was recorded in a triple 3 × 3 Latin Square design. The number of days necessary to observe the manipulation of rumen fermentation with MBEO was determined with an evaluation of nutrient digestibility, CH4 emissions, and microbial protein synthesis. Ruminal samples were collected at day zero (the day before starting the dietary treatments), and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 15 after MBEO introduction, while the subsequent 7 days were assigned for the nutrient digestibility trial and CH4 determination. On day 3, propionate concentrations began to increase (P < 0.01) for EO200 and EO400, which resulted in an associated decrease (P = 0.03) in the acetate: propionate ratio; this effect lasted until day 15. The enhancement (P = 0.003) in the overall mean of total short-chain fatty acids was consistent with the decrease (P = 0.06) in the overall mean of ruminal pH for both MBEO doses, compared to the control. A decline (P < 0.01) in the protozoal count was observed after a week in the EO400 treatment, whereas no differences were observed in the EO200 and control treatments. No significant differences among the three treatments were detected for ammonia concentration, dry matter intake, or total tract nutrient digestibility. A reduction (P = 0.009) in CH4 emissions was observed in the EO200 and EO400 [24.5 and 27.6 l/kg digestible organic matter (DOM), respectively] treatments, compared to the control (38.2 l/kg DOM). Among the treatments, EO400 resulted in the highest body nitrogen (N) retention (P = 0.03) and microbial protein synthesis (P < 0.01). The results suggest that the addition of MBEO favorably modifies the ruminal fermentation process, and 3 days of treatment is necessary before a stable and modified ruminal fermentation pattern can be observed. This pattern would last for a period of two weeks. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

These ecosystems are found across Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, North, Central, and South America. Particularly in Brazil, the Pantanal region has a series of hundreds of shallow soda lakes (ca. 600) potentially colonized by a diverse haloalkaliphilic microbial community. Biological information of these systems is still elusive, in particular data on the description of the main taxa involved in the biogeochemical cycling of life-important elements. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to contrast the composition and functional patterns of the microbial communities of two distinct soda lakes from the sub-region Nhecolândia, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. These two lakes differ by permanent cyanobacterial blooms (Salina Verde, green-water lake) and by no record of cyanobacterial blooms (Salina Preta, black-water lake). The dominant bacterial species in the Salina Verde bloom was Anabaenopsis elenkinii. This cyanobacterium altered local abiotic parameters such as pH, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen and consequently the overall structure of the microbial community. In Salina Preta, the microbial community had a more structured taxonomic profile. Therefore, the distribution of metabolic functions in Salina Preta community encompassed a large number of taxa, whereas, in Salina Verde, the functional potential was restrained across a specific set of taxa. Distinct signatures in the abundance of genes associated with the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur were found. Interestingly, genes linked to arsenic resistance metabolism were present at higher abundance in Salina Verde and they were associated with the cyanobacterial bloom. Collectively, this study advances fundamental knowledge on the composition and genetic potential of microbial communities inhabiting tropical soda lakes. © 2018 Andreote, Dini-Andreote, Rigonato, Machineski, Souza, Barbiero, Rezende-Filho and Fiore.

However, the biological effects of the EVs released by tumor cells on angiogenesis are not completely understood. Here, we aimed to understand the biological effects of EVs isolated from two cell lines of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (SCC15 and HSC3) on endothelial cell tubulogenesis. Methods: OSCC-derived EVs were isolated with a polymer-based precipitation method, quantified using nanoparticle tracking analysis and verified for EV markers by dot blot. Functional assays were performed to assess the angiogenic potential of the OSCC-derived EVs. Results: The results showed that EVs derived from both cell lines displayed typical spherical-shaped morphology and expressed the EV markers CD63 and Annexin II. Although the average particle concentration and size were quite similar, SCC15-derived EVs promoted a pronounced tubular formation associated with significant migration and apoptosis rates of the endothelial cells, whereas EVs derived from HSC3 cells inhibited significantly endothelial cell tubulogenesis and proliferation. Conclusion: The findings of this study reveal that EVs derived from different OSCC cell lines by a polymer-based precipitation method promote pro- or anti-angiogenic effects. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons-PAHs are considered mutagenic, carcinogenic and toxic, and can act as cofactor of this disease. In order to evaluate possible differences between green sea turtles with and without FP, we monitored 15 PAHs in liver samples of 44 specimens (24 with FP) captured in Brazil. We detected eight PAHs and quantified phenanthrene in all green sea turtles with FP. Specimens without FP presented lower values than the tumored ones (1.48 ng g−1 and 17.35 ng g−1, respectively; p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences between tumored and non-tumored specimens, among studied areas, or Southwest Atlantic Fibropapillomatosis Score. Even though we found higher concentrations in the liver samples of green sea turtles with FP, further studies are necessary to confirm if these pollutants are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

Flow-based procedures are generally characterized by high sample throughput, improved precision, minimized waste generation, and often better selectivity. The performance of detection systems is usually improved because of the in-line sample conditioning and measurements under reproductive dynamic conditions and timing. However, after achieving several innovations, perspectives for further developments have been questioned mainly because of the recent decrease in the number of publications on flow analysis. The aim of this review is then to discuss the impact of flow-based methods on chemical analysis, emphasizing recent applications and developments, including miniaturization, bioanalysis, microextractions, green analytical chemistry and synergic hyphenation with other techniques and processes. The author’s personal view about research perspectives in the field is also presented. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.	Review	Scopus

This technology has been used in several area-wide programmes for the suppression/eradication of fruit fly populations. Choosing the optimum sterilizing dose and the sterile release density is an essential step of the SIT. Considering unsolved issues related to the application of this technique against Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann), this study aimed to define accurately the central target dose for both sexes of this species and to verify the induction of sterility in fertile flies at different sterile:fertile ratios. The results from the regression analyses proved that the sterilization process for the A. fraterculus Brazilian-1 morphotype (the most common in southern Brazil and Argentina) could consist of irradiating pupae 72 h before adult emergence at 40 Gy, with no detrimental effects to standard quality control parameters. The ovarian development in irradiated females was characterized, demonstrating that doses equal to or higher than 25 Gy cause complete and irreversible ovarian atrophy. The laboratory and field cage tests showed that the sterility induction increased with the proportion of sterile flies, and a sterile:fertile ratio of 50:1 should be appropriate in SIT field trials. The sterile females apparently did not distract the sterile males, despite of the slightly higher reductions in pupal yield for all ratios in their absence. The data generated in this study have a great practical value and will help decision-makers in planning field trials to evaluate the efficacy of the SIT against A. fraterculus populations. © 2018 Mastrangelo et al.

As bromélias Guzmania lingulata e Vriesea 'Harmony' receberam fertilizantes nos seus tanques ou pelas raízes com solução de Hoagland & Arnon modificada, com 0,00, 2,62 ou 5,34 mmol L-1 de nitrogênio na forma de ureia. Após 90 dias, o conteúdo de nitrogênio nas folhas e a biomassa das plantas foram avaliados, e os índices de EUN calculados. Guzmania lingulata e V. 'Harmony' adubadas no tanque com 5,34 mmol L-1 apresentaram maiores médias de eficiência de absorção de nitrogênio e de eficiência de recuperação; as adubadas nas raízes, com 2,62 mmol L-1, apresentaram as maiores médias de EUN, eficiência de utilização de nitrogênio, eficiência fisiológica de nitrogênio e índice de eficiência de conversão de biomassa. Os índices de EUN, além de serem importantes ferramentas para avaliação do status nutricional das bromélias, revelam que o sistema radicular das bromélias epífitas é funcional para absorção e utilização de nitrogênio. © 2018 Embrapa.; The objective of this work was to evaluate if nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) indexes can elucidate functional differences in nutrient uptake between the root system and tank of epiphytic bromeliads. The bromeliads Guzmania lingulata and Vriesea 'Harmony' received fertilizers in their tanks or through their roots using modified Hoagland & Arnon solution, with 0.00, 2.62, or 5.34 mmol L-1 nitrogen, as urea. After 90 days, nitrogen contents in leaves and plant biomass were evaluated, and NUE indexes were calculated. Guzmania lingulata and V. 'Harmony' fertilized in their tanks with 5.34 mmol L-1 had the highest averages of nitrogen uptake efficiency and recovery efficiency; those fertilized with 2.62 mmol L-1 through their roots showed the highest averages of NUE, nitrogen utilization efficiency, nitrogen physiological efficiency, and biomass conversion efficiency. The NUE indexes, besides being an effective tool to assess the nutritional status of ornamental bromeliads, reveal that the root system of epiphytic bromeliads is functional for nitrogen uptake and use. © 2018 Embrapa.

O. Ktze and Acacia raddiana (Savi) species are local ressources important to feed animals in Sahelian area of Burkina Faso. Thus, this experiment was to investigate the in vitro effect of both Acacias on ruminal fermentation, CH4 production and rumen microbial community using a semiautomatic system. In all experiments, 25 mL of the inoculum solution was incubated with 50 mL of buffered rumen fluid at 39 °C and gas production was measured at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h. The results show that A. nilotica was rich in condensed tannins and fiber content compared to A. raddiana which was rich in total tannins. A. raddiana treatment presented greater degradability of organic matter and lower CH4 production compared to A. nilotica and control group (P<0.05). In addition, methanogenic archaeal were significantly lower in A. raddiana associated with increased fungal communities abundance compared to A. nilotica (P<0.05), but no effects was observed on rumen bacteria R. flavefaciens and F. succinogenes (P>0.05). We conclude that A. nilotica leaves showed negative effect on ruminal fermentation due to high fiber and CT content, and A. raddiana could be an interesting plant to increase fiber digestion and reduce CH4 production in vitro. © 2018 Tropical and Subtropical Agroecosystems.

This has favored the appearance ABZ-resistant nematodes and, consequently, an increase in its clinical ineffectiveness. Among the pharmaceutical techniques developed to increase drug efficacy, cyclodextrins (CDs) and other polymers have been extensively used with water-insoluble pharmaceutical drugs to increase their solubility and availability. Our objective was to prepare ABZ formulations, including β-cyclodextrin (βCD) or hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), associated or not to the water-soluble polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). These formulations had their solubility and anthelmintic effect both evaluated in vitro. Also, their anthelmintic efficacy was evaluated in lambs naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) through the fecal egg count (FEC) reduction test. In vitro, the complex ABZ/HPβCD had higher solubility than ABZ/βCD. The addition of PVP to the complexes increased solubility and dissolution rates more effectively for ABZ/HPβCD than for ABZ/βCD. In vivo, 48 lambs naturally infected with GIN were divided into six experimental groups: control, ABZ, ABZ/βCD, ABZ/βCD-PVP, ABZ/HPβCD, and ABZ/HPβCD-PVP. Each treated animal received 10 mg/kg of body weight (based on the ABZ dose) for three consecutive days. After 10 days of the last administered dose, treatment efficacy was calculated. The efficacy values were as follows: ABZ (70.33%), ABZ/βCD (85.33%), ABZ/βCD-PVP (82.86%), ABZ/HPβCD (78.37%), and ABZ/HPβCD-PVP (43.79%). In vitro, ABZ/HPβCD and ABZ/HPβCD-PVP had high solubility and dissolution rates. In vivo, although the efficacies of ABZ/βCD, ABZ/βCD-PVP, and ABZ/HPβCD increased slightly when compared to pure ABZ, this increase was not significant (P CloseSPigtSPi 0.05). © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

We conducted demographic surveys of leaf age composition, and measured the age dependence of leaf physiology in broadleaf canopy trees of abundant species at a central eastern Amazon site. Using a novel leaf-to-branch scaling approach, we used these data to independently test the much-debated hypothesis – arising from satellite and tower-based observations – that leaf phenology could explain the forest-scale pattern of dry season photosynthesis. Stomatal conductance and biochemical parameters of photosynthesis were higher for recently mature leaves than for old leaves. Most branches had multiple leaf age categories simultaneously present, and the number of recently mature leaves increased as the dry season progressed because old leaves were exchanged for new leaves. These findings provide the first direct field evidence that branch-scale photosynthetic capacity increases during the dry season, with a magnitude consistent with increases in ecosystem-scale photosynthetic capacity derived from flux towers. Interactions between leaf age-dependent physiology and shifting leaf age-demographic composition are sufficient to explain the dry season photosynthetic capacity pattern at this site, and should be considered in vegetation models of tropical evergreen forests. © 2018 The Authors.

These proxies are used to explore the evolution of terrestrial and marine influence on the lake. Isotopic (δ13C: −27.87‰ to −31.9‰; δ15N: −0.07‰–4.9‰) and elemental (total organic carbon - TOC: 0.58%–37.19%; total nitrogen - TN: 0.08%–1.73%; C/N: 0.3 to 54.7) values recorded in Lake Canto Grande suggest that the sedimentary organic matter was derived from mostly C3 land plants and freshwater phytoplankton. Particulate organic matter and cluster analyses distinguished four associations characterized by the predominance of amorphous organic matter, followed by phytoclasts and palynomorphs. These results indicate two different phases of lake evolution. The first phase (136 - 65 cm; ∼10,943 cal yr. B.P. to ∼8529 cal yr. B.P.) is recorded by sand layers interbedded with mud, which contain amorphous organic matter (AOM, 45–59%) and phytoclasts (opaques - OP: 6–18%; non-opaques – NOP: 17–23%) which indicate a floodplain area. The second phase (65–0 cm; ∼8529 cal yr. B.P. to ∼662 cal yr. B.P.) comprises mud, AOM (68–86%) and palynomorphs (PAL, 8–16%) related to lake establishment comparable to modern conditions. Thus, characterizing particulate organic matter, in combination with stable isotopes, proved to be invaluable proxies for lacustrine paleoenvironmental change through the Holocene. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

In this study, the effect of irradiation doses (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 kGy) on the quality parameters of long life tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), was evaluated during 4 storage periods (1, 7, 14 and 21 days). The different treatments were evaluated by analysing for colour, pH, total soluble solids (TSS), total titratable acidity (TTA), ratio (TSS/TTA), hardness, total lycopene and ascorbic acid contents, weight loss and maturation stage (O2/CO2 ratio) for all the storage periods. The tomato samples were irradiated in a Co60 irradiator and maintained at 22 °C ± 1 °C. The quality of the tomato fruits was influenced by the gamma radiation basically by making the fruits softer and not degrading the ascorbic acid and lycopene contents at the doses evaluated. The irradiation process used in the doses evaluated was promising with respect to maintaining the quality parameters of long life tomatoes. © 2018 Informing Science Institute. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to use the quantity and quality of SOM as an indicator to determine the sustainability of different land uses (native vegetation, secondary vegetation, fruit orchards, horticultural areas, degraded pasture, improved pasture, and fields with annual crops) in the eastern Amazon. Improved pasture had higher soil C stock than the other land uses and was similar to the native vegetation, and also presented the highest quantity of C in a stable form in the soil (fraction < 53 µm). According to the C management index, improved pasture is the most similar in use to native vegetation. Changes in land use reduced the soil microbial C content, although the more conservationist systems (fruit orchards, secondary vegetation, and improved pasture) had contents similar to those of the native vegetation. The highest soil microbial quotients were found in fruit orchards and horticultural areas. Well-managed pastures were effective in accumulating C as stable forms in the soil, which demonstrates the sustainability of this land use in the region studied. © 2018, Scientia Agricola.

In this region, > 15,000 shallow lakes are likely to contribute an enormous quantity of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere, but the diversity of the biogeochemical scenarios and their variability in time and space is a major challenge to estimate the regional contribution. From 4 selected alkaline lakes, we compiled measurements of the physico-chemical characteristics of water and sediments, gas fluxes in floating chambers, and sedimentation rates to illustrate this diversity. Although these lakes have a similar chemical composition, the results confirm a difference between the black-water and green-water alkaline lakes, corresponding to distinct biogeochemical functioning. This difference does not appear to affect lake sedimentation rates, but is reflected in gas emissions. Black-water lakes are CO2 and CH4 sources, with fairly constant emissions throughout the seasons. Annual carbon dioxide and methane emissions approach 0.86 mol m− 2 y− 1 and 0.07 mol m− 2 y− 1, respectively, and no clear trend towards N2O capture or emission was observed. By contrast, green-water lakes are CO2 and N2O sinks but important CH4 sources with fluxes varying significantly throughout the seasons, depending on the magnitude of the phytoplankton bloom. The results highlight important daily and seasonal variations in gas fluxes, and in particular a hot moments for methane emissions, when the O2-supersaturation is reached during the afternoon under extreme bloom and sunny weather conditions, provoking an abrupt O2 purging of the lakes. Taking into account the seasonal variability, annual methane emissions are around 10.2 mol m− 2 y− 1, i.e., much higher than reported in previous studies for alkaline lakes in Nhecolândia. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide consumption is estimated about 1.9 mol m− 2 y− 1 and 0.73 mmol m− 2 y− 1, respectively. However, these balances must be better constrained with systematic and targeted measurements throughout the seasons. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.	Article	Scopus

We aimed to evaluate the 15N recovery by sugarcane as affected by 15N-NH4                             + and 15N-NO3                             − addition. Methods: Under field conditions, 15N-labeled ammonium nitrate [labeling as 15NH4NO3 (15N-NH4                             +) and NH4                             15NO3 (15N-NO3                             −)] and urea were surface-applied at a rate of 100 kg N ha−1. Under controlled conditions, sugarcane was grown in hydroponic medium (containing unlabeled N) until the maximum N demand period. Subsequently, plants received 15N-NH4                             + or 15N-NO3                             − (as ammonium nitrate). Plants were then sampled at 1, 3, 7, and 15 d after fertilization (DAF) to estimate 15N recovery. Results: Under field conditions, the 15N recovery for urea was lower than that for ammonium nitrate, partly explained by ammonia volatilization, but there was no difference in N use efficiency between the two fertilizer N sources, as well as between 15N-NH4                             + and 15N-NO3                             − supply. Under controlled conditions, however, 15N-NH4                             + resulted in higher 15N recovery than 15N-NO3                             − until 7 DAF. Nevertheless, as 15N-NH4                             + became depleted in the nutrient solution, 15N-NO3                             − was taken up more intensely by the crop. At 15 DAF, highest 15N recovery was detected in the roots and whole plant under 15N-NO3                             − supply. Conclusions: Although uptake of NH4                             + is faster than NO3                             −, the so-called “preference” for NH4                             + by the crop did not necessarily translate into higher 15N recovery. Therefore, we suggest that the term “preference” should be used with caution to avoid misinterpretation. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.	Article	Scopus

The use of genetically modified (GM) plants has introduced several traits in agriculture, such as the improvement of plant drought tolerance, as observed in the AtAREB1 transcription factor overexpression in soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill). The present study aimed at investigating the taxonomic and functional profile of the leaf microbial community of bacteria found in GM (drought-tolerant event 1Ea2939) and conventional (BR 16) soybean plants. Bacterial DNA was extracted from leaf samples collected from each genotype and used for microbial diversity and richness analysis through the MiSeq Illumina platform. Functional prediction was performed using the PICRUSt tool and the STAMP v 2.1.3 software. The obtainment of the GM event 1Ea2939 showed minimum effects on the microbial community and in the potential for chemical-genetic communication, i.e. in the potential for symbiotic and/or mutualistic interaction between plants and their natural microbiota. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

The enzymatic cocktails for biomass degradation are mostly produced by fungi, but low cost and high efficiency can consolidate 2G technologies. A. fumigatus plays an important role in plant biomass degradation capabilities and recycling. To gain more insight into the divergence in gene expression during steam-exploded bagasse (SEB) breakdown, this study profiled the transcriptome of A. fumigatus by RNA sequencing to compare transcriptional profiles of A. fumigatus grown on media containing SEB or fructose as the sole carbon source. Secretome analysis was also performed using SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS. Results: The maximum activities of cellulases (0.032 U mL-1), endo-1,4-β--xylanase (10.82 U mL-1) and endo-1,3-β glucanases (0.77 U mL-1) showed that functional CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes) were secreted in the SEB culture conditions. Correlations between transcriptome and secretome data identified several CAZymes in A. fumigatus. Particular attention was given to CAZymes related to lignocellulose degradation and sugar transporters. Genes encoding glycoside hydrolase classes commonly expressed during the breakdown of cellulose, such as GH-5, 6, 7, 43, 45, and hemicellulose, such as GH-2, 10, 11, 30, 43, were found to be highly expressed in SEB conditions. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMO) classified as auxiliary activity families AA9 (GH61), CE (1, 4, 8, 15, 16), PL (1, 3, 4, 20) and GT (1, 2, 4, 8, 20, 35, 48) were also differentially expressed in this condition. Similarly, the most important enzymes related to biomass degradation, including endoxylanases, xyloglucanases, β-xylosidases, LPMOs, α-arabinofuranosidases, cellobiohydrolases, endoglucanases and β-glucosidases, were also identified in the secretome. Conclusions: This is the first report of a transcriptome and secretome experiment of Aspergillus fumigatus in the degradation of pretreated sugarcane bagasse. The results suggest that this strain employs important strategies for this complex degradation process. It was possible to identify a set of genes and proteins that might be applied in several biotechnology fields. This knowledge can be exploited for the improvement of 2G ethanol production by the rational design of enzymatic cocktails. © 2018 The Author(s).	Article	Scopus

This scenario highlights the importance of the association with microorganisms to foster plant growth, which becomes essential to the successful establishment of this forage in such environments. This study aimed to evaluate the genetic variability and identify the mechanisms of plant growth promotion, in vitro, of bacteria associated with Brachiaria decumbens Stapf. and Brachiaria humidicola (Rendle.) Schweickerdt in Pernambuco, Brazil. We evaluated 20 isolates of diazotrophic bacteria obtained from the endophyte or rhizosphere communities. The genetic characteristics were determined via sequencing the 16S rRNA region, which allowed us to identify ten different bacterial genera: Bacillus sp., Burkholderia sp., Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Microbacterium sp., Pantoea sp., Ralstonia sp., Rhizobium sp., Sinomonas sp., and Sphingomonas sp., with a specificity of the genus Rhizobium sp. to Brachiaria decumbens Stapf.. The phenotypic and functional characteristics revealed that 100% of the bacterial strains produced indol-3-acetic acid (IAA) with the addition of L-tryptophan, and 60% presented IAA production independent of the L-tryptophan pathway. We also detected that 70% of the isolated bacteria possessed the capacity to solubilize phosphorus. The analysis of the enzymatic output revealed that 30% of the bacterial isolates produced cellulase, 60% produced pectate lyase, 15% produced polygalacturonase, and 30% produced amylase. We also detected the production of N-acyl homoserine lactones in 65% of bacterial strains. In summary, our results showed that plants of B. decumbens Stapf. and B. humidicola (Rendle.) Schweickerdt interacted with different bacterial genera capable of promoting plant growth. © 2018, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Facultad de Agronomia e Ingenieria Forestal.

This species is generally found in aquatic environments of lowlands surrounded by tropical forests, and this is a rare case in which the species colonized high altitude lakes, situated amidst campo rupestre (rupicolous vegetation). This peculiarity instigated an interest on the natural history of these populations, especially on which lowland populations were the sources of the propagules that colonized the Carajás lakes. This study aimed at describing the genetic structure and divergence among four mountaintop populations in order to lay grounds for their long-term conservation. As an external comparison, four O. glumaepatula populations were used, three from Amazon Basin rivers (Solimões, Negro and Xingu), and another from the Paraguay Basin, in the Pantanal biome, in a total of 257 individuals. Eight microsatellite loci were evaluated in the eight populations. The Carajás populations showed less genetic diversity than the others, which suggests that they went through a founder effect as of their initial settling on the ridge. The fixation index was negative for the Carajás lakes populations, and this excess of heterozygotes is unexpected for a traditionally selfing species. This may be the result of selection for the ferruginous environment and/or due to the vegetative propagation of highly heterotic individuals. Two groups were detected, showing a lower divergence among the populations found in the ferruginous lakes at the mountaintops of the Carajás Ridge, when compared to the populations from riverine environments in the lowlands. For genetic conservation purposes, a large number of individuals was transplanted, based on the information generated in this work, to lakes devoid of natural populations of O. glumaepatula in a nearby ridge possessing the same rupicolous vegetation. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH	Article	Scopus

The objective of this study was to increase the Se content in the biomass of Brachiaria spp.with urea coated with Se. The experiment was performed in a typical Hapludox soil under greenhouse conditions. A completely randomized block design with four replicates in a factorial structure with two cuts and six Se doses (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160gha-1) was used. The Brachiaria brizantha demonstrated the absence of changes in higher harmful doses without modifying the activity of glutathione peroxidase enzyme. We concluded that enrichment of Brachiaria brizantha with coated urea is obtained with 34.5gha-1 of Se. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

Information on species that thrives in these HMLs is essential to direct conservation strategies in local and regional scales. Since HMLs are dominant in the Atlantic Forest, we aimed to assess the mammalian diversity in a HML in southeastern Brazil and to propose conservation strategies. We collected data of terrestrial (small-, medium- and large-sized) and volant mammals in three small forest fragments (10, 14 and 26 ha) and adjacent areas, between 2003 and 2016, using complementary methods: active search, camera trapping, live-traps, mist nets and occasional records (i.e., roadkills). In addition, we used secondary data to complement our species list. We recorded 35 native mammal species (6 small-sized, 16 mediumand large-sized, and 13 bats) and seven exotic species in the HML. The recorded mammal assemblage (non-volant and volant), although mainly composed of common and generalist species, includes three medium- and large-sized species nationally threatened (Leopardus guttulus, Puma concolor and Puma yagouaroundi) and two data deficient species (Galictis cuja and Histiotus velatus), highlighting the importance of this HML for the maintenance and conservation of mammal populations. Despite highly impacted by anthropogenic disturbances, the study area harbors a significant richness of medium- and large-sized mammals, being an important biodiversity refuge in the region. However, this biodiversity is threatened by the low quality of the habitats, roadkills and abundant populations of domestic cats and dogs. Therefore, we stress the need of conservation strategies focusing on the medium- and large-sized mammals as an umbrella group, which could benefit all biodiversity in the landscape. We recommend actions that promotes biological restoration, aiming to increase structural composition and connectivity of the forest fragments, reducing roadkills and controlling the domestic cats and dogs’ populations, in order to maintain and improve the diversity of mammals in long-term. © 2018, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

A better understanding of the relationship between microbial diversity, functions and environmental parameters would increase our ability to set conservation priorities. Here, the bacterial and archaeal community structure in Atlantic Forest, restinga and mangrove soils was described and compared based on shotgun metagenomics. We hypothesized that each distinct site would harbor a distinct taxonomic and functional soil community, which is influenced by environmental parameters. Our data showed that the microbiome is shaped by soil properties, with pH, base saturation, boron and iron content significantly correlated to overall community structure. When data of specific phyla were correlated to specific soil properties, we demonstrated that parameters such as boron, copper, sulfur, potassium and aluminum presented significant correlation with the most number of bacterial groups. Mangrove soil was the most distinct site and presented the highest taxonomic and functional diversity in comparison with forest and restinga soils. From the total 34 microbial phyla identified, 14 were overrepresented in mangrove soils, including several archaeal groups. Mangrove soils hosted a high abundance of sequences related to replication, survival and adaptation; forest soils included high numbers of sequences related to the metabolism of nutrients and other composts; while restinga soils included abundant genes related to the metabolism of carbohydrates. Overall, our finds show that the microbial community structure and functional potential were clearly different across the environmental gradient, followed by functional adaptation and both were related to the soil properties. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

Trace elements in 95 samples of dry food for dog puppies (n = 32) and adults (n = 63) of various brands were measured using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The mass fractions of most elements were within the permissible limits for dogs. Aluminum, antimony, and uranium presented fairly high levels in some samples, which may imply health risks. Aluminum mass fractions ranged from <21 to 11,900 mg/kg, in same brand, super-premium dog food. Antimony mass fractions ranged up to 5.14 mg/kg, with the highest values measured in six samples of dog food from the same producer. The mass fractions of uranium was found up to 4 mg/kg in commercial brands from five different producers. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.	Article	Scopus

Here we used a natural gradient within mangroves from seashore to upland, to contrast the natural variability in bacteria, cyanobacteria and diazotroph assemblages in a pristine area compared to an oil polluted area along a timespan of three years, based on ARISA (bacteria and cyanobacteria) and nifH T-RFLP (diazotrophs) fingerprinting. The data presented herein indicated that changes in all the communities evaluated were mainly driven by the temporal effect in the contaminated area, while local effects were dominant on the pristine mangrove. A positive correlation of community structure between diazotrophs and cyanobacteria was observed, suggesting the functional importance of this phylum as nitrogen fixers in mangroves soils. Different ecological patterns explained the microbial behavior in the pristine and polluted mangroves. Stochastic models in the pristine mangrove indicate that there is not a specific environmental factor that determines the bacterial distribution, while cyanobacteria and diazotrophs better fitted in deterministic model in the same area. For the contaminated mangrove site, deterministic models better represented the variations in the communities, suggesting that the presence of oil might change the microbial ecological structures over time. Mangroves represent a unique environment threatened by global change, and this study contributed to the knowledge of the microbial distribution in such areas and its response on persistent contamination historic events. © 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia	Article	Scopus

Thus, land-use change and riparian vegetation, such as deforestation and conversion of native forest to pasture lands, will lead to unwanted changes of the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems due to the disturbance of organic-matter supply. The C4 grasses, extensively used as forage in tropical regions, are poorly studied as important sources of allochthonous material because they are usually considered as a poor source of nutrients. Because the effects of land-use change on ecosystem functions are not fully known, we aimed to evaluate how such changes in riparian vegetation can affect nutrient cycling by means of measuring the decomposition rate of an abundant native C3 species and an exotic C4 grass species in first-order streams of the Atlantic Forest. Our results showed that C4 detritus decomposed faster than did C3 detritus, despite its lower nutrient concentration. This was likely to be due to the lower lignin concentration of the C4 species than the native C3 species. Lignin also influenced nutrient-loss dynamics of the C3 species, because it can interact with other cellular constituents and prevent the decomposition of most labile compounds. Our results supported the observation that the replacement of riparian vegetation alters breakdown rates and nutrient distributions, which may disrupt aquatic food webs. © CSIRO.	Article	Scopus

Here, we investigated the composition and metabolic potential of the rhizobacterial community of different common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) cultivars with variable levels of resistance to the fungal root pathogen Fusarium oxysporum (Fox). For the different bean cultivars grown in two soils with contrasting physicochemical properties and microbial diversity, rhizobacterial abundance was positively correlated with Fox resistance. Pseudomonadaceae, bacillaceae, solibacteraceae and cytophagaceae were more abundant in the rhizosphere of the Fox-resistant cultivar. Network analyses showed a modular topology of the rhizosphere microbiome of the Fox-resistant cultivar, suggesting a more complex and highly connected bacterial community than in the rhizosphere of the Fox-susceptible cultivar. Metagenome analyses further revealed that specific functional traits such as protein secretion systems and biosynthesis genes of antifungal phenazines and rhamnolipids were more abundant in the rhizobacterial community of the Fox-resistant cultivar. Our findings suggest that breeding for Fox resistance in common bean may have co-selected for other unknown plant traits that support a higher abundance of specific beneficial bacterial families in the rhizosphere with functional traits that reinforce the first line of defense. © 2018 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.

In the first experiment, the effect of pregnancy and genetic group were evaluated on 61 eleven month old Santa Inês ewes and their crosses with Texel, Dorper and Ile de France. Experiment 2 was carried out with 132 Santa Inês nulliparous or lambed ewes slaughtered with ages ranging from 6 to 48 months to evaluate the influence of age on carcass traits. For both experiments, hot carcass weight, cold carcass weight, carcass yield, cold carcass yield and carcass length were measured, as well as the yields and percentages of shoulder, neck, loin, belly, ribs, leg and leg length and perimeter. In experiment 1, the Santa Inês breed presented similar carcass and cut traits compared to the others genetic groups evaluated, except for fasting body weight. Lambed animals had lower body condition score than nulliparous females. In experiment 2, fasting body weight, loin, rib and leg weights, as well as the leg perimeter, presented a quadratic effect with increasing age. Ideal slaughter age is before 16 months to obtain more expensive cuts. © 2018, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

Cv. Brunella is an innovative lettuce variety which mixes crisp lettuce and head lettuce characteristics besides being adapted to the Brazilian growing conditions. The physicochemical and sensory quality of this lettuce, cultivated under different growing systems, was evaluated. The conventional planting and the hydroponic systems were carried out in the experimental area of the Universidade Federal de São Carlos, São Paulo State, Brazil and the organic system was done by certified organic producer in the municipality of Cordeirópolis. After harvesting, leaf area, leaf size, unit leaf area, fresh mass, mass loss, turgor pressure, instrumental color, pH, total titratable acidity (TTA), total soluble solids (TSS), total phenolic compounds (TPC), and sensory characterization were evaluated. We verified that the growing system influenced on physicochemical traits producing lettuces of different sizes, weights and stability. For pH, TSS and TPC, difference among the three growing systems was not observed. For TTA, the hydroponic sample showed higher acidity. About sensory evaluation, the testers noticed difference for green color, thickness, size and leaf crispness, grass aroma and bitter taste. The samples cultivated in conventional and hydroponic systems showed greater preference and purchase intention. © 2018, Sociedade de Olericultura do Brasil. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

In soil physics literature, especially in Brazil, several authors relate the inverse of the Van Genuchten parameter α to the air‑entry pressure. This study aimed to show this common interpretation to be erroneous, as 1/α corresponds to water contents lower than saturation. The deviation depends on the m parameter. In fact, α is merely a scaling parameter relative to the matric potential axis. Recognizing this mathematical fact may improve the interpretation of soil hydraulic properties based on water retention parameters. © 2018, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo. All rights reserved.

Biological mitigation has been considered as an alternative for environmental remediation and reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In fact, the use of easily adapted photosynthetic organisms able to fix CO2 with lowcost operation is revealing its high potential for industry. Among those organism, the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have gain special attention as a model organism for studying CO2 fixation, biomass accumulation and bioenergy production upon exposure to several environmental conditions. In the present study, we studied the Chlamydomonas response to different CO2 levels by comparing metabolomics and transcriptomics data with the predicted results from our new-improved genomic-scale metabolic model. For this, we used in silico methods at steady dynamic state varying the levels of CO2. Our main goal was to improve our capacity for predicting metabolic routes involved in biomass accumulation. The improved genomic-scale metabolic model presented in this study was shown to be phenotypically accurate, predictive, and a significant improvement over previously reported models. Our model consists of 3726 reactions and 2436 metabolites, and lacks any thermodynamically infeasible cycles. It was shown to be highly sensitive to environmental changes under both steady-state and dynamic conditions. As additional constraints, our dynamic model involved kinetic parameters associated with substrate consumption at different growth conditions (i.e., low CO2-heterotrophic and high CO2-mixotrophic). Our results suggest that cells growing at high CO2 (i.e., photoautotrophic and mixotrophic conditions) have an increased capability for biomass production. In addition, we have observed that ATP production also seems to be an important limiting factor for growth under the conditions tested. Our experimental data (metabolomics and transcriptomics) and the results predicted by our model clearly suggest a differential behavior between low CO2- heterotrophic and high CO2-mixotrophic growth conditions. The data presented in the current study contributes to better dissect the biological response of C. reinhardtii, as a dynamic entity, to environmental and genetic changes. These findings are of great interest given the biotechnological potential of this microalga for CO2 fixation, biomass accumulation, and bioenergy production. © 2018 Mora Salguero et al.

However, little is known about herbicide mixture effects in the soil, especially in tropical regions like Brazil. The aim of this study was to evaluate glucose mineralization in soils of contrasting textures (sandy clay and sandy loam) from areas cultivated with maize under application of S-metolachlor, terbuthylazine and mesotrione, alone and in a mixture. The methodology was established according to the soil microorganisms: carbon transformation test with14C-glucose solution (D-[U-14C] glucose) in biometric flasks. After the addition of14C-glucose, the amount of14C in cumulative CO2 of microbial respiration was measured several times during the 28-day incubation. For unamended soil control (without herbicide), microbial activity followed a similar behavior to amended soil with herbicides in total14CO2 released and accumulated, ranging from 23 to 27%. Overall, mineralization constant rate (k) values for all treatments were also similar, with an average value of 0.0038% CO2.d–1. Consequently, mineralization half-life times (MT50) were from 173 to 198 d. Microbial respiration for all treatments was slightly higher in the sandy clay compared with sandy loam soil; although soil samples with application of herbicides (alone and in a mixture) did not show decreased basal microbial respiration or mineralization rates of glucose. To corroborate these findings, additional research with different organic substrates and in cultures with different applications of herbicides are needed to prove the non interference of these herbicides on the microbial respiration in the soil. © 2018, Instituto Agronomico.

Ninety-six bacteria were isolated, subjected to biochemical tests, and identified by partial or total 16S rDNA sequencing. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant rhizospheric phyla found, and Burkholderia and Bacillus were the most abundant genera. Thirteen strains exhibited the four PGP traits evaluated, and most of them belonged to the genus Burkholderia. Two multi-trait PGP strains, RZ2MS9 (Bacillus sp.) and RZ2MS16 (Burkholderia ambifaria), expressively promoted corn and soybean growth under greenhouse conditions. Compared to the non-inoculated control, increases in corn root dry weight of 247.8 and 136.9% were obtained with RZ2MS9 and RZ2MS16 inoculation, respectively, at 60 days after seeding. The dry weights of corn and soybean shoots were significantly higher than those of non-inoculated plants, showing increases of more than 47% for both strains and crops. However, soybean root dry weight did not increased after bacterial inoculation with either strain. The colonization behavior of RZ2MS16 was assessed using GFP-labeling combined with fluorescence microscopy and a cultivation-based approach for quantification.

Whereas SPE mechanization leads to improved precision and higher sample throughput, as well as diminishes systematic errors and contamination risks, analyte concentration and separation from the sample matrix provides a remarkable impact on detectability and selectivity in flow analysis. Historical aspects, main cornerstones, tips for system design, and recent applications are critically reviewed, in the context of analyte(s) separation/concentration, sample clean-up, and release of sorbed chemical species involving both packed (e.g. mini-columns, cartridges, and disks) or fluidized (e.g. beads and magnetic materials) particles. Novel (bio)sorbents, selective synthetic materials, and stationary phases for low-pressure chromatography are also discussed. Moreover, the feasibility of SPE for sample treatment before chromatographic separation, as well as the exploitation of direct measurements on the solid phase (optosensing) are emphasized. © 2018, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

Bagasse is generated as a by-product and it is suitable for further degradation and fermentation for fuel generation. In the present study, the efficiency of alkaline pretreatments in the degradation of bagasse is assessed through microscopic analysis. Results reveal that the alkaline treatments expose the cellulose and hemicellulose residues in the bagasse fiber, enabling further fungus establishment. Penicillium colonization in the open fibers enhanced the biodegradation of sugarcane bagasse. The proposed methodology allows a detailed investigation of the deterioration process in the bagasse fibers - a vital step for biofuel production - as well as a comprehensive assessment of combined treatments. © 2018 Editura Academiei Romane.

Phytoremediation is the strategy with the least environmental impact for the remediation of metals, especially through forage grasses, given their important morphophysiological traits. However, to optimize the use of these plants, it is necessary to i) identify the main tolerance mechanisms of this plant group to metals; ii) to classify these plants as to phytoremediation strategy and metal accumulation; and iii) to identify prospects that favor metal absorption and contribute to the sustainability of this process. Some of the main tolerance mechanisms of forage grasses to heavy metals include exudation of metal chelating compounds; plasma membrane activity; retention of metals in the root cell wall; syntheses of thiol compounds, amino acids, organic acids, and sugars; and antioxidant system activity. Based on these mechanisms and potential use, 29 species of grass forages are indicated for phytoextraction and 18 for phytostabilization of different heavy metals, with 10 species that can be considered hyperaccumulators. Some strategies can be employed to increase the metal extraction efficiency of these plants, e.g., association of plants with chelating agents and/or microorganisms; fertilization with N, P, K and/or S; and breeding to increase absorption and tolerance to metals. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Brazil's extensive coast contains one of the largest mangrove forests in the world (encompassing an area of 25,000 km2 along all the coast). Endophytic bacteria were isolated from the following three plant species: Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa and Avicennia nitida. A large number of these isolates, 115 in total, were evaluated for their ability to fix nitrogen and solubilize phosphorous. Bacteria that tested positive for both of these tests were examined further to determine their level of indole acetic acid production. Two strains with high indole acetic acid production were selected for use as inoculants for reforestation trees, and then the growth of the plants was evaluated under field conditions. The bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens (strain MCR1.10) had a low phosphorus solubilization index, while this index was higher in the other strain used, Enterobacter sp. (strain MCR1.48). We used the reforestation tree Acacia polyphylla. The results indicate that inoculation with the MCR1.48 endophyte increases Acacia polyphylla shoot dry mass, demonstrating that this strain effectively promotes the plant's growth and fitness, which can be used in the seedling production of this tree. Therefore, we successfully screened the biotechnological potential of endophyte isolates from mangrove, with a focus on plant growth promotion, and selected a strain able to provide limited nutrients and hormones for in plant growth. © 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia	Article	Scopus

The availability of this test throughout the country is limited, mainly due to the difficulty in obtaining the labeled isotope from abroad. Recently, researchers from the Nuclear Energy Center in Agriculture at the University of São Paulo (CENA/USP) succeeded in synthesizing13C-enriched urea for Helicobacter pylori diagnosis. The aim of the study was to compare the performance of the13C-urea breath test using13C-urea acquired abroad with that of a test using13 C-urea synthesized in Brazil. METHOD: Sixty-four dyspeptic patients participated in the study (24 men and 40 women). Initially, the patients performed the13 C-urea breath test using the imported substrate (Euriso-Top, France). Seven to fourteen days later, all the patients repeated the test using the Brazilian substrate. The samples from both examinations were processed in an infrared isotope analyzer (IRIS, Wagner Analisen Technik, Germany), and all delta over baseline (DOB) [%] values above four were considered positive results. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (42%) exhibited negative results for Helicobacter pylori infection, and thirty-seven patients (58%) exhibited positive results when tested using the foreign substrate (gold standard). There was a 100% concordance regarding the presence or absence of infection when the gold standard results were compared with those obtained using the Brazilian substrate. CONCLUSIONS: Similar performance in the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection was demonstrated when using the13C-urea breath test with the Brazilian13C-urea substrate and the test with the substrate produced abroad. This validation represents an important step toward increasing the availability of the13C-urea breath test throughout the country, which will have a positive influence on the management of Helicobacter pylori infection. © 2018 CLINICS.

At the global scale, the upper 1 m of mineral soils contains 1300-1500 Gt C, more than twice the C stored in terrestrial plant biomass (Deevy, 1970: Post et al., 1982; Schlesinger, 1986). Human conversion of natural ecosystems to agricultural use can have an important influence on the fate of this stored C. Soils in natural ecosystems converted to cultivation show large changes in C concentrations, C stocks, and associated properties such as bulk density and soil structure (Schlesinger, 1986). Losses of soil C from a wide variety of soils under cultivation are in the range of 20-30% of the C originally present (Mann, 1986; Schlesinger, 1986; Davidson and Ackerman, 1993). Most of these losses occur within the first 20 years or sooner (Mann, 1986; Davidson and Ackerman, 1993). Grazing also influences soil C balance and soil properties, but these effects can differ from those of cultivation (Detwiler, 1986; Burke et al., 1989; Hassink and Neeteson, 1991; Naeth et al., 1990) and these changes are not as well studied. The losses or gains of soil C that occur following land use change, large amounts of C stored in soils, and large areas of land currently being altered for agriculture make soils potentially significant sources or sinks of C to the atmosphere (Houghton et al., 1985; Detwiler and Hall, 1988). © 1998 by CRC Press LLC.

Mining the draft genome sequence of the nostocalean MC-producing Fischerella sp. strain CENA161 led to the identification of three contigs containing mcy genes. Subsequent PCR and Sanger sequencing allowed the assembling of its complete biosynthetic mcy gene cluster with 55,016 bases in length. The cluster encoding ten genes (mcyA-J) with a central bidirectional promoter was organized in a similar manner as found in other genera of nostocalean cyanobacteria. However, the nucleotide sequence of the mcy gene cluster of Fischerella sp. CENA161 showed significant differences from all the other MC-producing cyanobacterial genera, sharing only 85.2 to 74.1% identities. Potential MC variants produced by Fischerella sp. CENA161 were predicted by the analysis of the adenylation domain binding pockets and further investigated by LC-MS/MS analysis. To our knowledge, this study presents the first complete mcy cluster characterization from a strain of the genus Fischerella, providing new insight into the distribution and evolution of MCs in the phylum Cyanobacteria. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd	Article	Scopus

This article describes and illustrates morphological and histological aspects of leaves and reproductive organs, and the germination process, to provide detailed information on this species and to contribute to taxonomic, phylogenetic and pharmacobotanical projects. The fruit is a cypsela, small, simple, dry, indehiscent, monospermic, light or dark colored, with aristate pappus, and the seed presents a spatulate axile embryo. Germination is phaneroepigeal with a pivotal root system and many absorbing root hairs. The leaves are simple, elliptical to obovate, with two types of trichomes (glandular and tector), with a short petiole, exhibiting an opposite decussate phyllotaxy. Our results showed 37.5% germination after 12 days, only in the dark cypsela, the light colored being considered unviable. The inflorescence is paniculate and the florets are grouped in capitula with isomorphic ends, monoclinous (bisexual), dichlamydeous, heterochlamydeous, pentamerous calyx and corolla, gamossepalous and gamopetalous. The androecium is gamostemone comprised of five stamens with free filaments, isodynamous and epipetalous stamens, synandrous and rimose anthers. The flower presents an inferior ovary, bicarpelar, unilocular and ovules with a basal placentation. The pollen grains are small, isopolar, radial symmetry, tricolporate, with echinate ornamentation. © 2018, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias. All rights reserved.	Article	Scopus

In MICal, only two calibration solutions are required: solution A, composed of 50% v v−1 of sample and 50% v v−1 of a standard solution containing the analytes, and solution B, composed of 50% v v−1 of sample and 50% v v−1 of a blank solution. MICal is based on monitoring the signal intensities of several isotopes of the same analyte in solutions A and B. By plotting the analytical signals from solution A in the x-axis, and from solution B in the y-axis, the analyte concentration in the sample is calculated using the slope of that graph and the concentration of the reference standard added to solution A. As both solutions contain the same amount of sample, matrix-matching is easily achieved. In this proof-of-concept study, MICal was applied to the determination of Ba, Cd, Se, Sn, and Zn in seven certified reference materials with different matrices (e.g., plant materials, flours, and water). In most cases, MICal results presented no statistical difference from the certified values at a 95% confidence level. The new strategy was also compared with traditional calibration methods such as external calibration, internal standardization and standard additions, and recoveries were generally better for MICal. This is a simple, accurate, and fast alternative method for matrix-matching calibration in ICP-MS.

However, little is known about leaching of mixture of herbicides in the soil, especially in tropical regions like Brazil. The objective of this study is to evaluate the leaching of14C-mesotrione (cyclohexane-2-14C-mesotrione) alone and in a mixture with S-metolachlor and terbuthylazine in seven tropical soil columns under laboratory conditions. These soils represented a wide range of properties with varying textures, cation exchange capacity (44 to 154 mmolc kg−1), pH (6.0 to 7.7), organic carbon content (0.58 to 27.32 g kg−1) and clay mineral contents (50 to 605 g kg−1), which are typical of tropical soils. Mesotrione residues were observed across all soil column layers (0–30 cm) in all evaluated soils by simulating 200 mm of water for 48 h. The application of mesotrione, alone or in a mixture, does not influence the leaching of this herbicide. Leaching of mesotrione ranged from low (up 15 cm) to very high (up 30 cm and leachate) in the tropical soils and may pose a potential groundwater contamination risk. In sand and loamy sand soil, the mesotrione was quantified in the leachate at all sampling times as above 80% of the amount initially applied. Thus, mesotrione application without the prior knowledge of the soil physical and chemical properties can result in inefficient weed control on field condition due to high leaching potentials. © 2017 by the authors.

However, the environmental behavior and fate of aminocyclopyrachlor are not fully understood. The aim of the present study was thus to evaluate the mineralization, extractable residue and bound residue formation of aminocyclopyrachlor in three tropical soils with different physico-chemical properties.14C-labeled [pyrimidine-2-14C] aminocyclopyrachlor was used to assess the fate of this herbicide in soil placed in biometer culture flasks. Total mineralization (accumulated 14CO2) of aminocyclopyrachlor was found to be <10% in all soils, decreasing in the following order: Oxisol—Typic Hapludox (clay) > Oxisol—Typic Hapludox (loamy sand) > Plinthosol—Petric (sandy clay). Overall, constant rate of mineralization (k) values for all soils were very low (0.00050% to 0.00079% 14CO2 day−1), with mineralization half-life times (MT50) consequently very high (877 to 1376 days), suggesting potential long persistence in soil. The amount of extractable residues decreased from ~31% to 50% in all soils after 126 days of incubation, indicating an increase in bound residue formation from ~5.0- to 7.5-fold compared to evaluation immediately after herbicide application, suggesting that degradation herbicide is involved in the formation of bound residues. Extractable residues are important factors that control mineralization and bound residue formation from aminocyclopyrachlor in the soil. The present study is the first to assess the fate, distribution, and formation of bound residues of aminocyclopyrachlor in soils. Aminocyclopyrachlor residues were predominantly associated with the OM and clay contents of soil. This effect of soil physico-chemical properties should be considered in environmental risk assessment of aminocyclopyrachlor and its application in the field for weed control. © 2017 by the authors.
